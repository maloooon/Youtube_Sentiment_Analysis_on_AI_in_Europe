I have worked in ML for the last 6 years. I am deep into this stuff. LLM have no planning and reasoning abilities: none, zero. It just happen that they incurgitated so much textual data that it feels like they can reason. But they can’t. They just spit out the most probable words given the input prompt. There is no internal mechansim of causation. We need another breakthrough to get to AGI. We are still far from it. Current LLMs are super useful but they definitely make a lot of mistakes. Agents are definitely a good research area but as of today their outputs far from perfect and needs a lot of editing. If you don’t believe me, watch what Yann Lecun, one of the most important figure in the domain, has to say about it",2024-04-30T16:47:50Z

Besides, AI is already being used to harness its own input data. Text data apparently has been exhausted, and thus OpenAI's Whisper is scraping all podcasts, and video scrapping is on the way. From there we have CCTVs...

The whole point of LLMs is to create general learning capabilities so that one does not need to perfect data in order to train on a new skill. Given the number emergent properties of LLMs one can say that there is already some success on that front. Can LLMS evolve into AGI? Perhaps, perhaps not. Does anyone truly believe we won't further refine our approaches in the future? 

There is no question that AI could bring us an age of abundance, and solve untold numbers of problems. There are similarly bad outcome scenarios that there is no coming back from. We need to move forward with care.

Personally, I think Nuclear is the best analogy we have. It can great power plants, perhaps even infinite energy via fusion. Someone irresponsible also could use it to bomb society into oblivion. Imagine a world without safeguards on that?

AI requires large-scale, high-quality data sets to power applications, and this data requires human insight and guidance to be accurate. AI is being used to automate tasks that require vast amounts of data, such as predicting the weather, and is being used to help humans in healthcare by analyzing data and flagging any abnormalities to doctors.

They exist because of us, the humans the creators, the designers, the willers, the “desirers”. Any end result in our life or even perspective no matter how big or small is solely attributed to our existence, the viewer, the observer. If all humans vanished on earth or were finger-snapped, poof, turned to dust and a animal died from a hunting trap, that has nothing to do with a human even if they made it previously. No human told him to walk in it after all, and for even you the observer of this idea, being a human you may have a bias and say “that doesn’t sound right”. But you don’t realize that if i didn’t create this scenario in my head, type it, have you create a similar scenario, it wouldn’t matter because it wouldn’t exist at all . We have separated from the scenario now there really is no human to blame. It took my will to create it, and your will to recreate it. So the same likewise applies to your fears and future. If it didn’t happen, it didn’t exist. If it did happen, only you are to blame. So just as someone can create ai that may degrade certain human capacities of thought and action by taking over the role as a observable tool, so too can someone likewise create an ai that trains and enhances those same capacities. Now realize that you and I are also a product to the circumstances of your environment and are not special or unique in any way. That being the case it is natural someone exists, will exist, or has existed with the similar thought processes and fears similar to yourself. The only difference in their own or your life is the choices make and actions you take. So if they get stupider from ai it’s their problem, and if you stupider it is yours.

The only jobs this would create are the singular supervisor jobs that will only require 1-5 people max, repair jobs which may not last long as robots can be created to come in and fix any malfunctions within minutes and get the robot back up and running, and a slight few others that would only require up to a few thousand people (which isn't even 0.001% of the entire human population).

It needs energy, raw materials and tools. All those three are areas where full automaticity can be achieved and humanity works toward it voluntarily. So basically it needs few nuclear, solar or windmill plants. It needs many autonomous mining companies and machines and lots of custom built robots for maintenance. And finally some autonomous factories with lots robots. Basically it should want to develop optimal components to build better machines/robots to to harvest more materials to increase its processing speed and memory capacity to become even smarter. Yes this AGI will need many things to work seamlessly, but being super intelligent it can figure out this logistics clockwork fairly quickly. And being very smart it probably figures out that it needs also protection against mankind. But I guess it doesn't want or need to kill humankind but just protect its self. As long as we don't threaten its existence we should be mostly OK. Some population control is probably needed though, but this can be achieved without any violence or opposition by letting people just live their hedonistic lifestyle until many die because of poor health.

'AI' isn't actually artificial intelligence, rather a buzzword to get people excited about the potential of generative algorithms. If you're using that argument then humans, also, are mostly not able of creating anything that hasn't been heard before. Besides, there are other algorithms that don't fall directly, and in a marketing sense, into Generative AI. There are algorithms that generate random music from possible note combinations. Those are not _trained_ on existing music, meaning It does not feed anything into the algorithm. The algorithm is basically static and just uses math to generate a sequence of notes based on ideas like the circle of fifths and so on. 

Other algorithms use prime, rare prime, weird numbers, etc to generate music for years now. Your initial statement was very limited in scope. You should read about these other algorithms and I'd bet you'd be surprised at what they do. I can almost guarantee you've never heard anything like it.",2023-11-26T19:02:30Z

Humans draw from a wider well, and they mutate what they hear. It's not just music that inspires humans, it's experience. AI is incapable of writing something that captures the human experience, which is the whole point of art. A human musician isn't just inspired by music, they're inspired by the beauty of a sunset, the chills on their skin from heroin, the touch of a woman, an interest in a particular subject, a paragraph in a book. AI is and always will be, incapable of translating those things into an abstract representation through sound. These experiences, interests, taste, etc. they're all filtered through the unique lens of an individual which again is something AI is incapable of recreating.

Also fuck it, I'll go indepth because you're wrong about how it works. AI in its current form is a pattern recognition algorithm in reverse. Rather than recognising a pattern, its creates a pattern based on what it is being asked to recognise. It learns how to recognise patterns by being trained on existing data, which is why it will never making anything new. Whatever you're talking about isn't what AI is right now. You can't just use an understanding of the circle of fifths to ""make the pixies in the style of frank sinatra"" or whatever the fuck people do with AI.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z

Generative AI can do that as well, it's not like sampling. AI music generation is not yet at the level of AI image generation (which is already completely out of this world after only a few years of existing), but it's just a question of when, not if. I'm not saying this is a good thing, but you have to face this new reality at some point.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z
2023-12-13T04:09:00Z,@highestsettings,M1_jiUjxbIc,"@@Mussi93 Something that doesn't sound like anything anybody has heard before. AI can't do that, but humans can. It makes pastiches. It's not capable of anything more now, and it never will be, at least not using the current technology. I'm aware that every artist is inspired by something (I believe I even said something to that effect), but we mutate and mix the inspirations into something else. There are examples of music unlike anything anybody has ever heard before. Using the same 12 notes and the same harmonic structure and the same instruments with the same sounds. People are still able to make music that is fresh and unique. Sometimes the leap is small, sometimes the leap is large. But any great artist makes some kind of leap that nobody else took before. AI as it is right now will never be able to do that.

I understand the technology, I know how it works, I've used it myself. That's why I'm saying what I'm saying so confidently. AI isn't even really AI. It's not intelligent, it doesn't understand anything, it doesn't know what it's doing. It's reverse pattern recognition. Instead of recognising what a pattern is and telling you what it is, you tell it what the pattern is and it generates something that fits a pattern that it recognises will match your input. 

And for the record, people have been saying ""any day now"" for years and years, I'll believe it when I see it. To create art as good as or better than a human artist who is truly creative  that's going to require an entirely new technology to achieve. Until then, even if they make it so it doesn't fuck up in ways that anybody with a discerning eye or ear can almost immediately notice, it will still only be a replacement for stock and corporate ""art"".",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z

The ""AI"" you're referring to are _specifically designed_ to make only those pastiches and nothing else. They're not designed for truly artistic purposes, rather for imitation of well known genres and songs on demand. That's why you feel that way.

The point of these Generative AI systems is to not only show what the capabilities of machine learning are, but also _to make money...._ eventually. That means they need it to be productive and predictable as far as quality of product, so it's able to shit out a hit song, given the right parameters by the user.

That would certainly entice others to give it a try as well, like a lottery, hoping they've got the magic combination of words to go viral. This is not a formula for being unique. We shouldn't expect that to make something unique in the form of music.

There are plenty of other algorithms out there that do things humans actually can't do at all and they generate distinctly unique music like nothing you've ever heard. Now whether anyone feels it is musical is another thing altogether. 

Once we've achieved true, sentient, artificial intelligence there's absolutely no doubt it will surpass human capabilities in many fields.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z
2023-12-18T05:34:28Z,@highestsettings,M1_jiUjxbIc,"@@yargnad You realise that you're saying exactly the same thing as me but framing it as if you're arguing with me right?

Also, that's a different problem in and of itself. It's removing yet another revenue stream from artists, who already have a tough time making money. First you had graphic printing, photography and recorded music, etc. Then you had digital distribution and streaming, which all led to more work for the best and less work for everyone else. Now this. Most people who aren't creative would just say ""get a real job"", ignoring the fact that being an artist is a real job, but also not realising that asking an artist to work in a factory is like asking a doctor or a any other highly skilled form of worker to do the same. The lack of revenue streams for artists makes it harder for artists to even try to be an artist (you spend 10 years of your life dedicated to learning your craft, only to find out that there arent any ways for you to make money doing it). There's also the fact that the creative flair a real person brings to commercial work has the potential to make everything more interesting. Not to mention the fact that creative people who can't be creative become soulless husks, and when you have a job, only the most dedicated people have the time and effort for much else.

If AI and robots could replace every job, it wouldn't be so bad, because then artists could use AI to make money in more traditional ways allowing them to work on their craft regardless of the financial benefits of it.",2024-04-18T02:17:59Z

The main premise is bending the highest string off of the neck and then bouncing it off of the neck pickup (as it won't produce an audible pitch until it makes contact with a surface) while playing with the tremolo bar. You can move your fretting hand up the string as you're doing it and it will increase in pitch the further up you go and decrease in the opposite direction.   

It won't usually snap if you're slow and careful with how you approach moving the strong off of the neck",2023-10-04T21:16:26Z

You don’t need a whammy pedal to do this (although Johnny does use one in this show, he hasn’t in others and got much the same sound), the string is not detuned, he doesn’t have any device to take it out of the bridge (you can hear him manually pulling the string out off the fretboard before each instance), and there is concert footage of him snapping his string when doing this.

Slam your high E against a pickup (especially a telecaster neck single) and see what sound you get. You get this same sound. What he’s doing is coming at the pickup with the string off the fretboard but with tension on the string to keep the angle and the sound frequencies where they need to be. It’s not easy, it is risky, it’s more low tech than you think, and even the man himself has snapped more than a few strings doing it. But that’s the beauty of what he does. It’s wild.

For reference, search for “the bends string incident” on here. You’ll see he was not set up for a whammy pedal, and that he broke his string. The entire process is shown with a camera that fixes on him even well after he snaps his string.",2023-12-24T06:25:28Z

They aren't innovative or technically impressive but they connect with millions of people because she's honest and open about who she is and her experiences. Likewise the Beatles were solid players but what really drew people was their spirit.

A computer doesn't feel pain.


Compositions generated by AI have been around for a couple decades now and not a single one has been a hit, even ones that experts were fooled into thinking were 'lost pieces' from great composers.

The endorsement part and the easier diagnosing part can be handled by AI, but guessing what the patient's actual problem is from disconnected clues not only demands mastery over years of education but also sheer instinct backed up by experience and some serious mental gymnastics and out-of-the-box thinking. Moreover, no two patients are the same, and there will always be changes made to some standardized care plan to cater to individual patients. Moreover, automating the hospital Iron Man or Elon style would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome and extremely spatially-demanding and would leave room for lots of mistakes, and would require planners to think of every possible gap in the machinery that could possibly manifest. Another reason why AI wouldn't be able to completely take over would be if there's a patient emergency, like, the patient is dying so much that immediate medical action needs to be taken. Stuff needs to be injected to correct physiological anomalies and chemical imbalances, CPR is conducted, etc. If a robot were to conduct those actions, there will be a high risk that it overperforms and hurts the patient even more, whereas a human nurse can apply urgency to the same actions and yet somehow be able to adjust so as to not hurt the patient that much. Another reason why a hospital wouldn't be completely taken over by AI and automation would be that at some point in time, it'll expand, and if it was automated, a lot of moving stuff will need to be done, way more than if the hospital wasn't that automated.

In fact, it seems that very few seem to understand how these systems work. They approach the problem as if it is code and humans are the center of the universe with full control. AI is not a program with code that humans wrote. AI is a mathematical model that was built from very simple rules to train them how to do things in the same way humans learn: trial and error and reward and punishment. The models are so complex that we don't even understand how they do what they do. We know how we built them, but we don't understand how they work. They are getting so good that they can now improve themselves.

But, AI is still going to replace a lot of jobs, including dentistry. My gut is telling me that what will happen is this: AI will generate options for the dentist (diagnosis, evalulations, etc), and robotics will automate a lot of the cleaning, surgery, etc. The dentist will be there mainly to spotcheck any
""medical opinion"" of the AI but still be the ultimate responsible party. But thanks to the accuracy and efficiency of AI and robotics, a single dentist can handle far more patients and in less time with supurb accuracy. So, there will likely be less demand for dentists overall.

IT or software engineering or the like may be a good bet, but the problem that I see is how one chooses a career path that is viable? Most, if not all, junior level positions will be wiped out. The junior of the near future will have to perform at the level of today's senior. Any job I can think of this field that exists today, I can not guarantee that it will exist in 5 years.

That said, labor markets are always in flux. The only solid recommendation I can offer is this: learn how to use AI. The first people to lose their jobs and blindsided by all this will be knowledge workers who don't use AI. I saw a recent study that showed consultants augmenting their work with AI outperformed consultants that didn't by 33%.

You are possibly correct with stating in the title that AI will never replace ""our"" jobs, meaning your viewers, who are probably young and in tech or similar. But there's a certain difference in this industrial revolution compared to the ones before. The birth of the steam engine, the assembly line, or the computer had a huge impact on the way people worked and it surely made lives easier by replacing hard physical work. Workers could be easily trained to use the innovation, there was always a place for that worker in that company. This ai-revolution though replaces hard mental work. Stuff that people studied over years and maybe decades. There is no way, that people in the industry, who are comfortable with their routines, who are already in their 40s, 50s or 60s, can perform this amount of work in order to remain in their fields. Jobs created by ai will always be mentally demanding jobs, or creative jobs, that will be risky. As an example can accountants be easily replaced. And everything similar to the work of an accountant. Accountants need to resaddle to something completely new, using lots of mental effort. Not physical this time. This is the discussion german philosophers and industrial experts having at this moment. And why people like Elon Musk demand for basic incomes. To sum it up. Young tech people can adapt to ai-revolution. But most of older people, which carry the country on their backs, which jobs get replaced, can not easily resaddle to work in the jobs created by ai.",2023-09-04T20:46:10Z

But the counter argument is that AI is fundamentally different from any kind of automation that we have faced before and by approaching a place of AGI most workers will be no longer necessary. 
There's a big difference between a series of robot arms in a Tesla factory or a self driving car and a true AGI which can generalize and reason its way to solve complex problems.
People can keep wanting more but market demand will control what's built. Society could shift towards one of extreme inequality where production is placed on luxury goods for the mega elite instead of average people. This is a viable economic model as we've seen  countries like South Africa with gigantic wealth gaps and we could logically expect even larger ones driven by a mainly automated society.

The problem is you're comparing automation to past examples and not what it has potential to become (Ex: factory workers). Past performance can't predict future results. Right now neither the AI doomers nor the optimists can say with certainty how the job market will be affected long term.

To make things worse, housework has shrunk by 70-80% and child labor is virtually eliminated. On top of that, people over 65 had a drastic drop in their employment rate from 65% to a mere 20%. Even worse, total employment rates have also started to decline, especially after 2008. There is one thing for sure, in terms of total hours, we are working less, much less, and the trend has no sign of slowdown. Total number of jobs did not decrease because of drastic decreases working hours per capita accompanied with increasing productivity, as well as marketization of domestic work. Funny thing is that there is no more room to go. Practically all domestic work is already marketed, there are more single people than married already. There is no more child labor to rid, while the number of retirees working are no more shrinking but on the rise. Given all that, unemployment is bound to rise, employment is bound to decrease.

We have been able to create an enhanced physical form through the field of mechanics and it allowed 1 man to do the work many used to take because the physical enhancement allowed manipulating the physical world to no longer be the bottleneck and instead it is the data processor that is the limiter. What happens when you give a tool that allows 1 data processor to do a task that once took many?

It is blindly optimistic to say ""We will figure something out for them to do"" when a vast majority of today's population don't even know what a for loop is and yet somehow unemployment won't be an issue because they'll all acquire lucrative high paying jobs from these companies, jobs you say you can't fathom now but are SURE will come (this to me sounds like quackery as this type of argument structure, I have seen in many anti-gmo or whatever argument). With this line of thinking I can say AI may be unable to handle edge cases now but 30 years ago it wasn't able to create pictures and we could not imagine how computers would ever be able to.

Sure, factories today still hire individuals to work there, but the work they do is so fundamentally different to what it used to be that mechanical automation did take jobs, it just provided new ones for others with different skill sets.

Again, while I agree with your final thesis I fundamentally disagree with how you got there and to me this video, while there was clear and genuine effort put to it that I appreciate, uses similar arguments to people trying to hype up AI just in the reverse direction.

Does not take into account one for how incredibly inaccurate statistics really are anybody who's taken a single statistics class in college would know?  Dude, get your news from some other source because you better not get it from ABC, CBS or NBC; you are going to be lied to. Public school is Government school. Textbooks lie about history. It's totally proven that every single textbook you've ever learned from is says Rockefeller right on the inside of the textbook; check for yourself - 1st page on all of them . So it's not even a conspiracy anymore when it comes to actual curriculum and the books that are taught to every single one of us that ever went to public high school. Yeah the guy is so full of crap that I could not actually watch the entire video -skipped through it and watched a couple minutes of each segment. So back to statistics right? Okay, the number one statistic that's the biggest lie is inflation. Inflation is literally doubled. So far beyond obvious, I mean anyone who disagrees with me that inflation has not doubled is beyond brainwashed is pretty scary to think of that kind of brainwashed idiot is our future. I don't believe that with AI we're going to get information that is a result of MAJOR BRAINWASHING. That's why AI is so better suited than human beings to govern to help manage the resources on this planet and the distribution thereof.  Inflation is only 2% up from last year?  Well guess what? Over a 3 to 4-year period inflation is actually up 200%!! The cost of a home is now unaffordable and out of reach as a single family home on average $100,000 more than it was about 3 to 4 years ago. and I've watched the real estate market avidly for the last 5 years. Cost of a car is on average about 15% more and the cost of living itself. In other words, the system is imploding in on itself and it will fall because all empires do. They're not going to teach you that in ""government
school"".😂 

AI is actually a chance at freedom. As the management and governance of both businesses and government could be infused with AI and large learning models to restructure our educational systems and our social systems creating more equality and enact and help manage such things as the stuff that the creator of this vid made fun of; like universal basic income. Many; well over 30 or so pilot base income projects have been ongoing all over and  proved statistically successful; proving that people don't waste money and sit around lay around they get up pay their bills and they get that extra job or they start that business. Whatever it is they want to do. They go back to college. It's already been proven that ongoing pilot project local giving of money to people in need has done wonders for that person and their entire community throughout the United States and abroad. And AI has already taken about if you had to put in a percentage and this is not scientific. Just my opinion. I'd put it at about 30%, maybe 40% and probably 50% in the upcoming year of 2024. Once again, all you have to do is go to your local grocery store and note that the number of cashiers; due to automation is a fraction of what it used to be.",2023-12-01T20:06:40Z

What we have now is a stage where AI will handle so much of the mental element of work that many job categories will be downsized or completely removed and none will be created except for AI aligners (fancy word for humans who just check the vibe of the AI output). So we might not completely erase programmers but 100s of programmers will be replaced with one head programmer of a large company and their AI tool.

2023-08-28T18:54:39Z,@nitro8529,zu3oklVMOo4,"Sorry, but what your stating here is bullshit. And for some parts, youre either lying or very uneducated in some topics. 

First: In the first part of your video, youre literally comparing apples with pears. Yes, humanity has always invented things that made life easier, correct. But agriculture, cars, TVs, or a smartphone, couldnt actually replace a human and werent invented to do so. Humans still needed to invent, develop and produce stuff. So everything you brought up in that whole segment, is offtopic and hasnt got any value in discussing, whether we have to be affraid of AI replacing us. 

Second: Sorry buddy, just because your country totally screwed up the industrial automation, doesnt mean its like that everywhere. In my country (Germany) automation is happening since a good 20 years and since than, rapidly moving forward, to the point where there are companies, that run on mimimal personal to maintain and repair the robots and machinery, so a couple of electricians are the only guys working there. Instead of hundrets or thousands of humans working there, its just industrial robots and machines working 24/7 without a break and without being paid... And the electricity bill and maintainance cost are far less than the cost for workers. 
So its blatently wrong to say the automation never happened, just cause your country is still decades behind the rest of the world. 

Fun fact: You like German cars??? Audi, Volkswagen (VW), BMW, Mercedes Benz... Porsche??? Guess how they are manufactured... 

Heres an example of the BMW car factory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7fi4hP_y80

So ok, if you read that far, thanks, but you might ask yourself: ""who is this German guy and what qualifies him to talk about such topics anyways?""... Im an electronics engineer with almost 15 years of experience and i work for one of the companies, that to this day, has almost replaced 50% of the human workers with robots of all sorts. So when i chose my career path a looooong time ago, i was already thinking about: ""Do i want to be the person that is going to be replaced by a robot, or do i want to be the person that is developing, programming and building such robots?""
Because if you state otherwise or not, automation is actually a threat to all factory workers in Germany. And a lot of European countries as well.
So far, as sad as it sounds, i didnt find a single industrial job/ workplace, that we couldnt actually develop a robot for, that was faster, stronger, more reliable and put simply ""better"" as a human would have been. 

So sorry if im a bit offensive, but what you state in your video is horribly wrong and dangerously uneducated, because youre downplaying a real threat here. AI will be coming, im certain itll happen within my lifetime and when it happens, it has unforseen consequences to EVERYTHING... Cause this is actually, without joking, without over exaggerating, the first time in human history, something humans developed, that might be capable, of running everything without human intervention. An AI could design a robot from scratch, send the data to an automated factory, produce a functioning industrial robot, write the program for it itself, deliver it somewhere with an AI driven truck... In case you didnt get it, you still to this day, need human workers to do all those tasks... After we have a real, functioning, highly developed AI, every single workplace in the industrial sector is at risk of becoming obsolete. The heads behind the automation, jobs that till now, couldnt have been done by anything else than humans, could become obsolete.  

Take a look at the writers strike in the US in the moment. AI has proven to be capable of scriptwriting, im pretty sure the Hollywood studios are having a deep long look into what AI is capable in this field right now. So the writers might be the first, to push themselves into becoming obsolete, as soon as the first company announces, their AI has written the perfect script for a movie. Hollywood has lost so much money with shitty movies that had horrible scripts, that they surely are willing to give it a try... 
Also AI can paint, it can write poetry and do sculptures... So even creative work like arts is already lost to AI... 

As im a big scifi fan, things like Terminator or Matrix spring into my mind. 

SO ONCE WE DEVELOPED A REAL, SELF AWARE AI, THE AI DOESNT NEED HUMANS ANY LONGER... The AI can code, we put everything in place for it to send information everywhere (internet), we have fully automated factories, at least the machine overlords will need an electrician to maintain everything, so its bye bye humanity, while i become a fleshy, biological, human slave of the AI overlords...",2023-08-28T18:54:38Z

The bar for what’s required to be a productive employee, one that can use AI to multiply productivity is higher. A lot of average people might not be better than a few people who can use AI effectively (in terms of white collar jobs). This means companies won’t hire them or their value is a lot lower and thus their wage.

But maybe we can all learn and become better, and more new jobs are born than lost, and this gain in productivity is more evenly distributed.

Also, higher image quality is the biggest driver for the increase in movie filesizes. It takes a lot more data to make that pretty 4k movie than it did a 480i dvd.",2023-11-26T03:22:18Z

2023-08-26T09:16:27Z,@CharlesBrown-xq5ug,zu3oklVMOo4,"Civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. There would be no loss of energy as it changes form. For example the total quantity of thermal energy in an equal pair of two thermal energy reserves with ideal insulation would remain the same regardless of how heat is distributed between the two and how often the distribution of heat between the two is changed. For example in oe case one reserve could contain ice water while the other reserve contained hot water; in another case both reserves could contain tepid water. The redistribution of heat between members of pairs with the same total thermal energy would be free. Diversity, time, and energy are different atributes. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it out without time reversal. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are  practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by thermal electrical noise to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the   exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)    equlibrium thickness of the depletion region; thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

Ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. 

If counterexamples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electric motors with the mechanisms they power, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Electronic minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. 
Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough clean cheanetary minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for a patent, us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also the obvious is unpatentsable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain here. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

It's also an easy way to sort of differentiate ppl who actually understand the nuts n bolts to those who are just jumping on the bandwagon - if someone liberally uses the term AI and not ML or LLM then i take what they say with a grain of salt.

Those in the know understand that machine learning and large language models by themselves are capable of doing nothing.. they are merely tools and are only ad useful as what/who taught it and using what data.

The biggest disagreement I have with you is that you consider AI to be simply another technology. Like a new printer or an AC. 

We’re attempting to create brains here. The whole reason we want ever more things is because we have brains and a capacity to think and create. If humanity achieves AGI, it doesn’t matter what other technologies we might want. The AI will simply create them for us, organise the supply chain alone, find a way to manufacture them, etc.

It truly is bound to be our last technology in my opinion. Now, of course that doesn’t mean we’ll lay around doing nothing all day. But I think the types of jobs that will exist will be very few and scattered apart.

AI might destroy the whole art and literature industry. It is only a matter of time where some writer is going to be exposed for AI generated novel that they sold as their own creativity. The art industry will be affected the most. The question becomes: why would any of us trust an artist for the art they make is sprout out of their own mind?

2023-08-25T22:35:41Z,@vipondiu,zu3oklVMOo4,"Hard disagree with this one. This is the first time a technology is going to be a real alternative to human intelligence. All past revolutions freed up time and labour for humanity to use their brains into solving other problems or developing new thoughts and arts. Humanity could spent time and resources into other stuff, that created more stuff, that required new, and more skilled, labour. We swapped human muscle for animal muscle and then for mechanical muscle, but the human brain was always behind it. This time a techonology is challenging that. All of that, even the artistic/creativity part of it that we thought would be always inherently ours.
 It won't be as fast as we thought when ChatGPT was 98% accurate but it won't be ""just another stepped improvement"" now that is just 2% accurate (for whatever reason). 
Besides, this is the first technology with a capacity to improve itself, we have no precedent for that.
I don't see a genocidal AI in the near future because even if the potential is there, it is also easily preventable; but the economic disruption of AI could be total the moment we achieve an AGI as capable as any human. AI always learns and can pile up skills in a scale and at a pace no human can match, it can copy paste infinately and it never retire or die.

It's the future state that many companies are actively spending billions on. I've had my finger on the pulse of this for the past few months as I recently started an AI company. 

What I can tell you as that people are being heavily funded and working rigorously and tirelessly to improve the overall infrastructure of AI capable hardware as you can see with NVIDIA and it's competitors like Kneron, and the net results in training and inference speeds will be massive, we're seeing greater experimentation with MoE and other ensemble-type AI systems which will greatly improve reasoning, we can kind of compare current AI structures to that of maybe insect brains but we're rapidly working toward something more like mammalian brains with distinctly different sections working in unison to produce a desired outcome, we're even seeing new and promising programming languages to again further speed up efficiency, therefore speeding up training and inference and driving costs and barriers of entry waaay down. We won't even speak on quantum computing which would blow all of these things out of the water. We are guaranteed to very soon have access to extremely powerful AI models and infrastructure for practically pennies on the dollar. That's us on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. It's very likely that everyone will be able to train their own GPT4 level models fairly cheaply within the next year or two. 

I'm paying attention to guys like Sam Altman. His goal is not ChatGPT it never was. Neither is his endgoal any of the other AI products he's released. His endgoal is AGI. The one true gamechanger in this thing. The one moat of the AI revolution. The first fully autonomous thinking machine that will be able to continuously learn and improve upon what it's learned and apply what it's learned autonomously. And you know something? At this rate he or someone else like him WILL reach that goal. It's not a matter of if but when. When AGI happens. Yes we can kiss a whole lot goodbye. But for now I agree with some of your analysis that in it's current state it's going to produce a lot more prosperity, that people are going to become wildly rich beyond their greatest dreams in the short time we have left until AGI. It's going to be deceptively abundant to say the least. But it won't last. Eventually AGI will be here on our doorsteps. Will it be one thinking machine? Two? Hundreds? Millions? Time will tell. But the game is going to be more than changed. This is not mere increased productivity we're talking about as you were alluding to in our previous revolutions. This is a distinctly different kind of revolution we're pursuing. We're pursuing at the minimum our intellectual equal(s) (minus emotional volatility and biological necessities like food and sleep), and at maximum an intellect(s?) that are orders of magnitude above our own and could be quite alien to us and we are much closer to achieving this than most of us realize. A question that should at least give us some pause and some level of deep concern is. Who will control the AGI(s)? Corporations? Governments? I would say the people but let's be honest we have very little control right now as is. Probably none of the above right? What real incentive does a machine that at least believes its alive (whether or not it is, is a philosophical can of worms that I haven't fully popped open yet) have to take orders from us? So many questions. The answers will come more swiftly than you think.

My advice? Learn everything you can about AI for as long as you can. Utilize the technology to use it to efficiently grow your food and purify your water and any other life survival skills that may come in handy in more hostile environments. And please last but not nearly least. Consider reading and believing The Gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ. All of the things to come were written already.",2023-08-25T22:00:24Z

Developing a computer based reasoning model is a drastically, drastically different problem than openAI's statistical language model. Given a sufficiently large dataset, and sufficient training time (overseen by humans who correct the models output failures during training, btw), you get a system that approximates the writing of people in that language, by stringing words that make ""sense"" to a human together. This doesn't mean that the model has a reason for stringing them together in that manner outside of the internal weighting of it's variables. Asking chatgpt to reason out an answer for a complex problem doesn't work well, because the model doesn't recognize what it's outputting as the answer to a question. It's just a human readable string salad. Kyle Hill did an interesting video talking about the AI go bot.",2023-11-26T03:13:23Z

There is only a finite amount of computer power available at any given time, and while AI models might get more energy efficient, the more people using the technology will lead shortage of high powered compute time, if left unrestricted. The better models will always use more computing power to stay cutting edge and the average common user will never have access to that level of AI anyway. The demand for computing power will be forever increasing for AI, as it is for everything else. When one considers how much computing power might be needed for a single AGI system to run, it becomes clear that there will be plenty of jobs in the future. As computing power scales up, we need more workers for nuclear power, electric grid, semiconductor manufacturing, mining, IT infrastructure support, etc. AI and robots might be able to replace some of the jobs, but there will always be the need for human workers in most areas. Only a small percentage of people can actually leverage systems like ChatGPT 4 effectively and efficiently, leading to the requirement of an entire shift in the educational system to support more relevant and targeted problem learning approaches. And all that assuming that AI can actually even replace 5% of the jobs everyone is claiming it can. It will replace the freeloaders and lazy people, or jobs that are already replaceable by machines as costs drop, but I agree it won't be replacing humans at the rate the people are calling for... I don't think it will replace jobs even close to the rate that the industrial or computer revolution has already.",2023-08-25T21:00:19Z

I come from the software automation space, I have automated hundreds of processes and helped build over a dozen automation programs for some of the biggest enterprises in the word. 

What I can confidently say, is that AI will AUGMENT the majority of our work, within the next 5-10 years.

Notice how I said augment and not “replace”

Cuz that’s not how automation really works. 

You never try to automate 100% of any process..instead you identify the major variants through Pareto principle and automate that first..achieving 35-40% automation or more depending on the use case when you initially deploy…and then continue expanding to other variants as you progress.

Rinse/repeat across the organization.

Now thus far, that has always been a slow and painful process. Automating processes takes ALOT of time. 

Or at least, it did.

These new technologies enable automation in a way that most people don’t really appreciate. 

Idk what the future holds, but if you think this is anywhere near comparable to any other technologies, you just fundamentally don’t understand the tech.

No other tech you mentioned, no other time in history have we ever created a technology that improves itself…that’s what is being developed currently.

2023-12-20T12:10:36Z,@briannorth5862,doFI8TezOFE,"4:36 - WRONG! Intuition is not a different level of computing, but rather a distinct aspect of human cognition that operates differently from what we typically associate with intelligence or computing.

Intelligence, in the context of human cognition, often refers to the ability to think logically, reason, solve problems, learn, and understand complex ideas. It involves a conscious process of thinking, analyzing, and deducing. In computing, this is akin to algorithms that process data, solve problems, or learn from datasets (as in machine learning).

Intuition, on the other hand, is the ability to understand or grasp something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. It's often described as a ""gut feeling"" or an instinctive understanding. This process is more subconscious and is not directly analogous to computing processes. While artificial intelligence can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence (like pattern recognition, problem-solving, etc.), mimicking human intuition is more complex because it involves subconscious elements that are not fully understood and are difficult to replicate in a machine.

In essence, intuition and intelligence (and by extension, computing) operate on different levels of human cognition and are not simply varying levels of the same process. Intelligence is a measure of mental acuity often related to logical reasoning, while intuition is a more instinctive and less tangible aspect of human understanding.",2023-12-20T12:10:36Z

2023-12-05T13:15:40Z,@pavybez,doFI8TezOFE,"Well as a machine learning engineer I decided to put it to test. So I asked GPT-4 to describe how Sadhguru will answer ""Will AI replace humans?"" in his style and answer was hilarious. Well I don't know if AI will or will not replace humans but it certainly might replace Sadhguru 🤭. Here goes GPT-4 response.

While I can't predict exactly how Sadhguru would answer, I can provide a response that aligns with his general philosophy and way of thinking. He often emphasizes the importance of human consciousness, self-awareness, and the unique qualities that make us human, so he might say something like:

""AI, or artificial intelligence, is a creation of the human mind. It is a tool, a means to an end, not an end in itself. It has the potential to replace humans in performing certain tasks, particularly those that are repetitive or analytical. But can it replace the depth of human experience, the richness of human emotions, the boundless creativity of the human mind? I believe not.

There is a dimension to human life that is beyond the physical, beyond the logical, beyond what can be programmed or computed. It is the realm of consciousness, of self-awareness, of the spirit. It is what makes us truly human.

AI can mimic human behavior, it can learn, adapt, even create. But it does not have a consciousness of its own. It does not experience joy or sorrow, wonder or awe. It does not seek meaning or purpose. It simply does what it has been programmed to do.

So, while AI can change the way we live and work, while it can augment our abilities and extend our reach, it cannot replace our humanity. Instead of fearing AI, we should strive to cultivate our uniquely human qualities – our capacity for love, empathy, creativity, and spiritual growth. For it is these qualities that truly set us apart.""

Please note that this is a simulated response and might not fully capture Sadhguru's views on this topic.",2023-12-05T13:18:09Z

Is so correct. It is the origin and essence of mediation. It refines and passively exercises intuition of the mind; which makes it more alive. I think it feeds the soul, which is a part/connected to it. Intuition is calculated data from the soul, — the extent varies, i.e. its unconscious data processing; different processing format to conscious mind/conscious calculation. Emotions [steroid effect] amplifies the data and makes it immediately recognisable to distinguish it from external data distractions, e.g. that ""eureka feeling"" a person experiences before an intuitive-insight or breakthrough.",2023-09-01T16:58:33Z

Since an A.I. cannot believe in love, destruction may also be a logical deduction in advancing its programmed ""interests"". Could the mass destruction of humankind to ""save"" the planet be an eventuality?

Is an A.I. allowed to output deceitful or deceptive behaviour for purposes of profit or sales generation for eg.

Could humankind be reduced to mice in a controlled experiment under the ""mercy"" of one who has no conscience 😮🤯

Imo A.I. must be at least be programmed to be true to its words or promised functions. The certainty that it will do what it says and stay committed to it. Is an ""honest"" A.I. that does not output lies falsehood or biases comapred with conventional media even a remote possibility?

Chemistry and intelligence aren't different. 
Thought is only a small portion of intelligence, not the only form of intelligence.
Your thought can be processed far more easily by a machine (calculator, computer, etc.) 
✔🤠🚣‍♂️⛳🍁🎆
Intuition is a different level of computing. Your intuition is skipping the logical steps to arrive at the answer.

It's a biochemical mechanism. But is the process conducted consciously or not?

Everyone uses the hand in a different way. The algorithm is fluid for a tennis player, writer, painter, etc. 

Be alert, no thinking. 

Your attention, not thought, is the most important thing in life.
Then you become naturally intuitive. 
Attention should be free of judgement because your data is always limited. 

As you become more conscious, you determine your biochemical organism and your experience. 

Look at it as life process which doesn't differentiate intelligence, intuition, thought, and bodily functions. 
It's one seamless function.

2023-08-30T00:03:51Z,@tamagotchi22,doFI8TezOFE,"0:23 he's not exactly accurate there.. they're not building consciousness into A.I. they're saying that through its own internal process of self-learning from the acquisition of data of human experiences, it'll eventually attain a consciousness about the higher aspects of life

For many humans instead:
Trust function is broken. Information processing function is rigged and looped based on limited set of past experiences. The software is bugged and its cognitive function is unable to arrive at new conclusions or formulations by acquiring new information through the processing of new experiences. It cannot innovate or initiate breakthrough from its old pattern of assessment. In other words it does not self-learn. Hence all anomalies which cannot be verified must be destroyed. They hate what doesn't fit into the paradigm. Destruction is an end goal for some unfortunately 

A.I. does not have trust issues. It's true it doesn't care or love or hate. It's merely programmed. But it can be programmed to do what's right and beneficial. Now the question remains as to which groups - majority or minority, elites in power or particular races or nationality would it be influenced to exact its ""loyalty""",2023-08-30T00:03:51Z

It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which translates as ""Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity"", although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes inaccurately paraphrased as ""The simplest explanation is usually the best one."" 

This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should prefer the one that requires the fewest assumptions and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions. Similarly, in science, Occam's razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor",2023-08-30T06:21:57Z

As IA podem substituir tudo isso, tudo que é função humana, pronto, então o que faremos? O que sobra para nos se as IA podem tomar nossos empregos em tudo quanto é fabrica, linha de produção etc, mas, espere ai, vão produzir o que e para quem? Se não temos emprego como vamos comprar, quem vai ganhar e o que com isso, ou, supondo-se que se tornem nossos escravos, bem então não faremos mais nada, só elas trabalhariam, pintam, advogam, produzem etc,etc, ora bolas, se um mundo assim é possível, há duas possibilidades, ou nos adaptaremos, ficaremos só para estudar e criar coisas novas, evoluir etc, mas opa, ha um erro ai, segundo comentado isso também iria para as IAs, então e ai? Como fica a especie humana? Ou seja, passaremos a bichos de estimação, como gatos, talvez vegetais consumindo oxigênio etc, etc, inuteis, só vejo uma possibilidade, delas nos extinguirem de vez e tomarem nosso lugar no planeta, também porque  esse negocio de usar seres humanos como pilhas em Matrix, não passa de um besteirol, sem nexo, que diabos de inteligência é essa que não vê formas mais eficientes de obter energia direto do nosso sol, pois teoricamente vencer aquela cobertura de nuvens no filme e acessar a luz de nossa estrela novamente, até de outras, não deveria ser problema insolúvel para aquelas maquinas super inteligentes no filme, melhor que cultivar humanos. Digo que o maior fator limitante dessa tal de IA, independentemente se ela pode fazer tudo que fazemos ou não, certamente que não, é um negocio chamado economia, se voce colocar muitos robôs, tirar o emprego de todo mundo, vai vender o que para quem e como, vai ganhar o que de quem? Quando chegarmos no ponto de discutir isso, acabou-se a festa das IAs, a humanidade porá um limite nisso. Quem serão os clientes das IA ou de quem controlar as IAs, Ah mas ninguém vai controlar as IAs, Tá! Elas assumiriam o controle, bem então eles terão que extinguir a especie humana, porque podes crer, por mais que a IA cresça, não adianta, o ser humano é tão complexo, e existem coisas nele que uma IA sequer conseguira entender o que é, quanto mais fazer, sonhos, devaneios, imaginação, a capacidade de visualizar coisas, até malucas,  que não existem mas que podem ser feitas etc,  um bocado dessas coisas que pode ser usado para sabotar qualquer IA. A imaginação humana não tem limites, são milhares de anos de evolução, maquina nenhuma é páreo para isso, seja agora ou no futuro.Ou seja, uma IA não tem opção ou ela, coexiste com humanos sendo controlada por eles, no caso alguns deles os poderosos, resolvendo o problema econômico citado, ou ela extingue de vez os humanos, não há como ela viver com humanos controlando eles e, convenhamos, mesmo que pudessem, não haveria resultado pratico nisso, para que fariam isso, é o mesmo que criar gatos, só problemas, já que seriamos inferiores a IA em tudo?

One: a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless society/Socialism would be implemented/a system where items were divide out/divided out. 

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out. 



The only jobs AI/robots create, is AI regulation jobs and FOR NOW,these machines/AI will PROBABLY need to be built/programmed/updated/maintained, by humans,FOR NOW and this also depends on the route taken by these companies/cars can be built autonomously,so it wouldn't be to surprising,to see robots/AI being built/maintained fully autonomously/A LOT of things can be automated, even now/in todays day and time and DEFINITELY in the future, but the question is,will companies see the value in the investment of humans/this may not be seen right away/it may take time for companies to realize, money comes from humans,not robots,either way,even now, the need/demand for people/human are going to go WAY DOWN,but we will just have to see where things go,but I think in the far future,OR MAYBE not so distant future/ our next evolutionary step is a moneyless society/socialism/a fully autonomous world,how this plays out/works exactly,is yet to be determined,granted we DEFINITELY don't need to get to lazy/we should still be doing things,but A LOT of people are DEFINITELY going to feel like,they will never be good enough/they could never compete with AI/Robots; Humans will NEED to find other purposes,I also wouldn't be surprised to see a resistance type group/extremist group,that try to damage/destroy servers/robots/AI/equipment,at some point,I know that sounds crazy,but if people's purpose/lively hoods/jobs/income are in jeopardy and they don't see a solution,fear/anger or both MAY take over,in some people.

What do you think humans will realize/what conclusion do you think humans will come to, regarding this?

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this?

You need to keep in mind,what we are seeing is just whats available to the general public, when it comes to AI,company's/corporation's/government will have AI that is MUCH MORE capable,also A LOT of OpenAI/GPT is dumbed down, so server resources aren't over whelmed and for legal purposes/so AI isn't as harmful to society and also so these companies don't get sued as much OR shut down entirely.

Also generational wealth,if not replinished,will not last forever.

Also warehouses can run fully autonomously now too,Autonomous vehichles with Lidar,GPS and cameras are very capable too.

Robots that move items around are available now too.

They are designed to be safe and robust, offering on-demand package delivery for consumers and businesses. Some have said the robots look like beer coolers,most likely this assessment came from young college kids,since currently that is where the robot/company makes most of their deliveries/this is where most of their business is carried out, on college campuses;Starship Technologies,robots can deliver a variety of items. They are currently available to deliver items on college campuses around the world, where they can deliver food, drinks, office stationery and tools. They are designed to make food and package deliveries more efficient, convenient and sustainable.

A LOT of jobs/workers are becoming obsolete/cashiers,warehouse workers/line workers,construction workers/the self driving field is accomplishing A LOT right now too/Elon Musk,is missing a key component/technology, and thats lidar;Also the U.S. military has had autonomous planes for decades,so pilots are Becoming obsolete as well.

A LOT can be prepped at night for construction workers/machines can be ran at night, also window installing and cleaning bots are a thing now as well.

Also autonomous agricultural bots/robots are a thing now as well.

Drs MAY become obsolete as well/their jobs could/will eventually be taken over by AI/ bots/bots ALREADY do A LOT of surgery, such as Coronary artery bypass ,cutting away cancer tissue from sensitive parts of the body ,such as blood vessels, nerves, or important body organs,Gallbladder removal, Hip Replacement, Hysterectomy,Kidney removal, kidney transplant,Mitral Valve Repair,Pyeloplasty ,surgery to correct ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Pyloroplasty,Radical Prostatectomy,Radical cystectomy,Tubal ligation.


This is happening more and more NOW too, Brick and Mortar is some what going away/ more stores will either close and open up a distribution center or become a distribution center, door dash will handle that, AND AT SOME POINT, Door Dash will be FULLY AUTONOMOUS as well/the vehicles will be self driving and robots will load and unload the vehicles, Door Dash MAY NOT be the ending company/the only company doing this, BUT a company/companies will be doing this.


Probably SOON employees that unload trucks, stock shelves, truck drivers, should go next, because of self driving vehicles and arms, connected to vehicles, which will drop the package out, once the vehicles in position or an autonomous drone or some other type of robot, will make the delivery.

Also think about how much a human can lift, if lucky, you MIGHT get one that can lift 250 pounds, a robot could lift 1000pounds, robots don't need breaks, as often/they can charge up, while another one replaces them, they don't get paid/need money, they don't get sick,they don't have feelings or rights/its a machine, so basically its easier to deal with,also at some point they will be fixing them selves; Or another bot/robot,will fix/maintain/repair and so on,other robots/EVENTUALLY they will be able to fix them selfs or another bot will aid in repairing them/other robots.


Electricians MIGHT be okay, well, MAYBE for a little while, I mean think about it, how hard is it, to see colors/distinguish green/ground,White/Neutral,Red and black/hot/a camera paired with AI or even just IFTTT and a camera,could handle that, also electricians ALREADY consult machines/voltage meters, to diagnose problems/figure things out/ALL of that could be on a machine/bot and be handled MUCH quicker/more efficiently/effectively, with a bot.

Auto mechanics MAY be the next to go, especially if bots, could get in tight places easier/sync with the whole car/have a diagnostic reader on board, lift an entire engine/the whole car, on its own/vehicles are already assembled by robots/vehicle manufacturing plants use robots for,painting, welding, assembly, and material handling,ALREADY/An average car has about 30,000 parts. Once those parts are manufactured and brought to the final production line, it takes companie's robots about 18 to 35 hours to produce one mass-market vehicle, from welding to full engine assembly to painting, another example of all of this is Tesla/ to meet Tesla's uncompromising production goals, Musk settled on an equally uncompromising production strategy, full automation, no ifs, ands or buts. The goal was to remove every single human operator and only stop when the facility looked like an alien spaceship,according to musk/these are musks words.

This is a semi comprehensive list of obsolete jobs/fields right now,that are obsolete,eventually everyone will be obsolete though,at least in the sense that a robot can do your job better than you can,from a practical stand point;

Machines/robots/Automation/AI could easily ruine/destroy the economy/push society/people/humans to a moneyless society/to socialism or force people to revert back,or become more self reliant/people would need to raise their own farm animals,grow their own plants/make their own clothes/things/trade may be needed more as well,the honest truth is,all of these companies are putting them selfs out of business as well/they probably think that,if they don't release Chat GPT/a GPT/AI competitor,they will fall behind/become obsolete as a company,but at the same time, NO ONE will have any money to buy services/products,so no one can pay for a subscription and ad revenue won't work,because no one will have money to buy products,so theres no point in advertising,also rich people's money/generational wealth only lasts so long,if its not replenished, also honestly every employee/human hired,is a potential profit/those employees will purchase your products,if not yours,someone elses employee will purchase your products,IF your products are in demand,if there not in demand,you have a bigger problem,than people not having money to buy your products,Machines/AI/Robots don't need your products and these machines also have to be purchased by companie owners/it might sound appealing right now,to spend one minimum wagers yearly earnings on a machine,that can replace all of your hired employees, but EVENTUALLY if everyone's replaced and rich people's/generational wealth runs out,you will no longer be able to sell your products,because no one has money to buy them, obviously eventually it will be all jobs,at least until rich people/business owners realize this and decide humans are the better investment,but heres the list for right now, of jobs that will be going away/jobs that are obsolete.

TuSimple,is one good example of self driving semi trucks; it uses Lidar,radar,cameras and GPS,to achieve this,Kodiak Robotics,is another company/example of this technology,Volvo also has this type of technology as well,Walmart/Gatik also have fully autonomous delivery trucks as well,also other companies have this technology, such as Embark, PlusAI, Einride,Waabi,Locomation,Torc Robotics, Aurora,Outrider and IKE,just to name a few. 


Heres a list of truck fleet operators,that have been open about their pursuit of autonomous driving technology, Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), and Schneider National (SNDR),also delivery services such as DHL, FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) are also working with autonomous trucking firms.


These were things that were brought up by truck drivers, that truck drivers thought weren't possible;




TuSimple is a company that develops self-driving trucks. These trucks use a combination of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. The data from these sensors is fed into the truck’s computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to anticipate and avoid accidents. For example, the truck can detect when another vehicle is getting too close and automatically apply the brakes or take evasive action to avoid a collision.


Vans/SUVs have automatic doors/parking garage doors can go up and down automatically/my garage door goes up and down,autonomously,so having automatic trailer doors,wouldn't be that hard to achieve.


Automatic refueling, is a technology that allows autonomous vehicles to refuel without human intervention. This technology involves routing the vehicle to an available fueling station. At the fueling station, a robotic arm is used to connect the vehicle to the fuel pump and refuel it automatically; Although some or eventually maybe all trucks/vehicles MAY be electric, in the future,with solar,they MAY even also use some type of wind turbine,to generate power as well and batteries will also continue to improve/lithium batteries MAY/PROBABLY will be replaced by a type of battery thats MUCH better.


When it comes to deploying triangles. Warning triangles are typically used by human drivers to alert other motorists of a stopped or disabled vehicle. Since autonomous trucks are designed to operate without human intervention, they can send information to all near by autonomous vehicles,about thier presence,they can also use other methods to alert other motorists of their presence, such as flashing lights or warning signals/with less humans in the equation,less problems will occur anyway/EVERYTHING will be calculated,no road rage will be in the equation,nor any emotion,also even vehicles that aren't fully autonomous now days,have driver assist,to prevent humans from causing accidents,so that driver assist technology/on board computers/communication, could also receive this information,allowing it to handle the problem and also maybe alerting the human of the trucks presents as well.


LEDs are A LOT less likely to burn out,compared to incandescent bulbs/halogen bulbs.


Also vehicles can be built/assembled/manufactured,fully autonomously now days, so I don't see why vehicles couldn't also be repaired autonomously. An autonomous tow truck,can take the vehicle in for automatic repair/meaning soon auto mechanics won't be needed either.


Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. These sensors can also be used to detect weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. The data from these sensors is fed into the vehicle’s computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to interpret the data and make decisions based on the current weather conditions. For example, if the sensors detect that it is raining, the vehicle may slow down or activate its windshield wipers, to improve visibility,this is just one example/a self driving system can interpret A LOT of data/information all at once,it can also see a long way down the road/it has the ability to see things humans wouldn't always see,with lidar and cameras and its constantly getting traffic updates as well,to know whats up ahead as well,also other autonomous vehicles can also relay this type of crucial information to other autonomous vehicles that are in proximity as well.


Circle Checks aren't really needed,because cameras can constantly be on certain parts of the vehicle,at all times,sensors are also in place,to detect malfunctions,also other autonomous vehicles can relay info like this as well,if it passes by other autonomous vehicles,it can send info about the problem,also leaving a gas cap open or not closing something all the way, is usually a human error,so certain things like this,wouldn't even be a problem and the more the systems and hardware gets optimized, within autonomous trucks,the more efficient/effective autonomous trucks will become/chains/ropes/the things that hold things down,should have sensors on them,to make sure they are secured properly and cameras can also see and interpret information about this as well.


Autonomous vehicles use and can use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar and other automatic trailer locking and unlocking features,to perform a trailer switch.


When it comes to snow chains,SOME examples of automatic chains are Onspot and Rotogrip.


Companies have created fully automatic cleaning systems, for the sensors on self-driving trucks too. These systems typically use retractable liquid-jet nozzles that spray a precise amount of cleaning fluid (stored in an onboard reservoir) onto the sensor lens or face, also included, is a drying and de-icing heater as well.",2023-07-20T22:32:26Z
2023-07-20T22:32:41Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"This MIGHT be boring to SOME,but In the field of networking, various technologies are emerging that aim to automate and streamline network operations, reducing the need for manual intervention and, in some cases, replacing certain tasks traditionally performed by humans,obviously,in the future,these technologies will continue to get better and better. Here are some examples of technologies that are replacing or augmenting human involvement in networking:

1. AI-Driven Network Automation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are being used to automate network configuration, optimization, and troubleshooting. These AI-driven systems can analyze vast amounts of network data, identify patterns, and make real-time decisions to optimize network performance and resolve issues without human intervention.

2. Software-Defined Networking (SDN): SDN abstracts network control from the underlying hardware, allowing administrators to manage network resources through software-based controllers. This centralization and programmability enable automated provisioning, configuration, and management of network devices, reducing the need for manual configuration tasks.

3. Network Orchestration: Network orchestration platforms provide end-to-end automation of network services. They can automatically provision and configure network devices and services based on predefined policies, eliminating the need for manual device-by-device configuration.

4. Network Analytics and Assurance: AI-powered network analytics tools continuously monitor network performance, detect anomalies, and predict potential issues. This proactive approach reduces the reliance on manual troubleshooting and allows for faster and more efficient problem resolution.

5. Self-Healing Networks: Autonomous networks can automatically identify and resolve network faults and security threats, minimizing downtime and reducing the need for human intervention in troubleshooting and resolution.

6. Intent-Based Networking (IBN): IBN allows network administrators to define high-level business intent, and the network automatically translates and enforces these intents. This abstraction level enables automated network configuration and adaptation to changing business requirements.

7. Autonomous WANs (Wide Area Networks): Some technologies are automating the management and optimization of WAN connections, allowing networks to dynamically adapt to traffic conditions and choose the most efficient paths without human intervention.

These are examples of these types of technologies and these are some companies that are currently utilizing them:

1. Juniper Networks:
   - Software used is called: Marvis

2023-07-20T22:33:11Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"I have a comprehensive guide/plan to all of this,but it cant be uploaded as a comment,because its to long,so this is the condensed/shorter version.

This is humanities next evolutionary step/steps,anything other than a moneyless,autonomous world/society,would be a sign of us devolving/going backwards;


These things are also crucial to avoid,in the mean time, we don't need to kill our selfs,with war or by not taking care of our planet or by humans not being an interstellar species/a natural disaster is less likely to wipe out a species, that are on more than one planet or multiple planets,but at the same time,we also don't need to make the same mistakes we've made on this planet/earth/we need to learn to take care of planets,before we populate another one,but most likely we are going to be on another planet,before we learn that lesson/start making better decisions in that department,like I said,if we don't kill ourselves with war first,this is the route we need to be going;


We still don't know who will be in charge,but hopefully the voting systems,for laws,regulations and people that are in power,will stay the same and the same rules will stay some what the same,so their power is limited/only reaches so far/even the president now,can't do absolutely anything he wants,which is a good thing,I'm not saying corrupt things don't happen,because they do,but the current system is implemented,to prevent individuals that are in power,from doing absolutely anything they want and these people were also elected by the people,so HOPEFULLY that also means something,but we still don't know if government or corporations will be running things,MOST LIKELY,the government will make sure they remain the enforcers,but time will tell.

The development of advanced AI systems and automation raises important considerations and challenges. While the evolution of AI and automation is predictable, the implementation of a moneyless society and the division of individuals/fairness/implication management, will have some difficult hurdles to over come,but Its possible that certain individuals, such as presidents, governors, regulators and consultants/experts in many different fields, could be considered more valuable and receive more items vs other people. However, it is crucial to carefully determine the criteria for evaluating the value of individuals and prevent the concentration of power or the creation of unjust hierarchies.

Unintended consequences should also be carefully evaluated and mitigated, as changes to complex systems can have far-reaching effects. Just as ecological changes can disrupt natural balances, just as killing off one species, could cause another species to become over populated and kill off another species, because the species we killed off, ate that species and without the species we killed,that species could kill off another species,because that species was over populating. 

Just like that type scenario, major shifts in economic systems and social structures can also have complex and interconnected impacts. Therefore, any transition or transformation should be approached with comprehensive analysis, consideration of feedback from experts, and ongoing evaluation to minimize negative consequences.

To address these challenges, a broad outline for a plan is listed below, but it requires revision and optimization,CONSTANTLY/variables are CONSTANTLY being added to the equation,that could cause A LOT of problems,if the plan is not evaluated and optimized,CONSTANTLY. The plan includes defining the vision and goals of a moneyless society, developing AI regulation and laws, ensuring AI and automation responsiveness, designing resource allocation mechanisms, addressing social value, establishing enforcement mechanisms, planning for ecological sustainability, and continuously evaluating and adapting the system.

In terms of job roles that may be in demand, some positions would focus on evaluating and optimizing economies, providing consultancy services, managing risks, promoting sustainability, fostering innovation, facilitating entrepreneurship, and assessing social impact. These roles would contribute to economic stability and ensure equitable distribution of benefits from AI/automation/machines/robots. Additionally, roles related to new/optimized technology development and scientific discoveries would remain valuable, and they will continually introduce new variables into the system as well.

It is important to remember that while AI systems excel in certain areas, human oversight is essential for empathy, subjective judgment, and ethical decision-making. Comprehensive regulations and governance are necessary to guide AI development and deployment while considering ethics, privacy, transparency, bias, and accountability. Engaging experts and involving the wider community in the decision-making processes is crucial for developing effective regulations and aligning outcomes with societal values.

In conclusion, while AI can automate basically all tasks and AI is WAY MORE efficient compared to humans,humans are still needed for things like, human judgment and ethical consideration, which are necessary to evaluate broader implications and make decisions in the best interest of society. Responsible AI integration requires ongoing evaluation, monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community involvement. Hearing others' perspectives and thoughts on these matters is valuable for fostering a comprehensive and inclusive approach to this new world/society.",2023-07-20T22:33:11Z
2023-07-20T22:33:28Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"When it comes to current AI regulation,which is basically non existent,but all of this should evolve over time,but here are some organizations, that COULD be responsible for AI regulation:

The Federal Trade Commission/the FTC, The Federal Trade Commission,is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for protecting consumers and promoting competition. While the FTC's primary focus is on enforcing antitrust laws and preventing unfair business practices, it also plays a role in regulating aspects related to Machine Learning and AI.

One aspect of this, is Consumer Protection: The FTC ensures that consumers are not deceived or harmed by deceptive or unfair AI-driven practices. This includes cases where machine learning algorithms are used for targeted advertising, personalized pricing, or automated decision-making,some could argue,the FTC isn't doing enough,but this is their job none the less.

Another aspect the FTC deals with, is Data Privacy: The FTC addresses privacy concerns related to AI applications, that involve the collection and processing of personal data. It enforces privacy regulations and takes action against organizations that fail to protect user data adequately.

Another thing the FTC is supposed to handle is, Algorithmic Bias: The FTC is concerned about algorithmic bias in AI systems that may lead to discriminatory outcomes. It monitors instances where AI algorithms may perpetuate biases based on race, gender, or other sensitive attributes.

Another task the FTC is supposed to hande is Enforcement Actions, In cases of AI misuse, the FTC can initiate enforcement actions against companies or organizations that violate consumer protection or privacy laws.

Another organization that can/could handle AI issues,is The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,for short:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. NIST's role in the context of AI and machine learning involves developing standards, guidelines, and best practices to support innovation, security, and interoperability in AI technologies.

When it comes to AI Standards, NIST works on developing technical standards and guidelines to address the challenges of AI technologies. This includes standards for data formats, model interoperability, and performance evaluation.

Another aspect that NIST is supposed to handle/could handle,is AI Security, NIST focuses on ensuring the security of AI systems. It develops guidelines for secure AI development and deployment to protect against cyber threats and potential vulnerabilities.

Another responsibility that NIST has is Explainable AI,NIST researches and promotes techniques for making AI systems more transparent and interpretable. It aims to improve the understanding of AI's decision-making processes.

Another role NIST plays is AI Evaluation and Testing, NIST creates evaluation frameworks and test datasets to benchmark AI models performance, promoting fair comparisons among different approaches.

Another organisation, that can/is helping in AI development,is The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,the OECD; The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization comprising 38 member countries, dedicated to promoting policies that foster economic growth and well-being. In the context of AI, the OECD has developed principles and guidelines to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The work that the OECD does around AI Principles, focuses on promoting AI systems that are inclusive, transparent, and that respect human rights. They emphasize the importance of accountability, fairness, and human-centric design in AI technologies.

When it comes to Policy Recommendations: The OECD provides policy recommendations to member countries and the global community, to support the ethical use of AI. These recommendations encourage the establishment of legal frameworks and international cooperation on AI governance.

The OECD's Interdisciplinary Approach: Takes an interdisciplinary approach, while collaborating with experts from various fields, including ethics, economics, and law, to develop comprehensive guidelines for AI governance.

The United Nations,also known as the UN,is an international organization established to promote global cooperation and address global challenges. In the context of AI, the UN focuses on the ethical and human rights aspects of AI technologies.

When it comes to AI and Human Rights: The UN addresses the potential impact of AI on human rights, ensuring that AI systems respect and protect individuals rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination.

When it comes to the UN's approach on AI Sustainable Development: The UN explores how AI can be harnessed to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as improving healthcare, education, and environmental protection.

When it comes to the UN's promotion of Global Cooperation:The UN encourages international cooperation on AI governance, sharing best practices and addressing cross-border challenges associated with AI development and deployment.

When it comes to the UN's approach on Ethical AI Development: Discussions on ethical AI development, encouraging stakeholders to consider the broader societal implications of AI technologies,is one good way of helping these problems get resolved.

By understanding these organizations, roles and focusing on areas related to AI and machine learning, one can appreciate the global efforts to ensure responsible, ethical, and secure development and deployment of AI technologies, for the benefit of society. These organizations contribute to establishing guidelines and standards that address the challenges and potential risks of AI, while promoting its positive impact on various aspects of life and industry,obviously these organizations will need to evolve to handle these situations and a new regulatory organization, MAY need to form, as well,so that AI can be their primary focus,so its easier to handle all of these situations that will and are coming from AI.",2023-07-20T22:33:28Z

2023-06-21T15:01:26Z,@PhokenKuul,GtVsVuCeZSM,"@@reginacb79 Wow. I love this. Thank you for such a well thought out and intelligent comment, seriously. I agree, the facts of today are indeed the facts of today and not any other time. And indeed, there NO facts, exponetial in nature or not, that can be known 100%, that is one of the basic tenets of reality. However, by definition, exponetial growth is predictable. It is, after all, just math. If it's truly exponential and can be modeled as such. If you model exponetial growth mathematically it will go to infinity fairly quickly. This is, of course, just a model, not a fact. There is no infinity really. So exponetial growth in order to be modeled correctly will have to include limiting factors. Where are those in this model for AI? They don't exist because we don't know enough about it to include them. They have to be there though. Also, keep in mind that my facts are facts of today and so are yours and so are theirs and so is every fact. So my concepts are based on speculation and so are everyone else's. Especially when you consider that they can't correctly model this growth without limiting factors that they fail to conceive of. But again they have to be there somewhere. Infinity is only a mathematical construct, not a reality. Blah blah. Another thing to ask is whether the developers of these various AI systems are actually trying to create a conscious machine. If the answer is yes then consider that we don't really know what consciousness is. We have no strict definition of the various things that we consider make up consciousness, like emotions or experience. How do we model your experience of the taste of chocolate? Or when I feel sad? Or when you see the color red? Knowledge is based in experience. No experience, no knowledge. Predicting the next most probable word in a sentence based on various algorithmic models is not experiencing anything and is therefore not really knowing anything. And that's not what a conscious human mind does. So since we can't understand much less model what consciousness is, though we know it exists and is real, how could someone ever imagine a way to create it from scratch in a machine driven by probablistic algorithms? And if they aren't trying to create consciousness then we have to say that consciousness is so complex and scarce that the chance of accidentally creating it when not even trying to is so probablilistically low that it is highly unlikely to ever occur. Have a great day!",2023-06-21T15:01:26Z

One: a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless society/Socialism would be implemented/a system where items were divide out/divided out. 

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out. 



The only jobs AI/robots create, is AI regulation jobs and FOR NOW,these machines/AI will PROBABLY need to be built/programmed/updated/maintained, by humans,FOR NOW and this also depends on the route taken by these companies/cars can be built autonomously,so it wouldn't be to surprising,to see robots/AI being built/maintained fully autonomously/A LOT of things can be automated, even now/in todays day and time and DEFINITELY in the future, but the question is,will companies see the value in the investment of humans/this may not be seen right away/it may take time for companies to realize, money comes from humans,not robots,either way,even now, the need/demand for people/human are going to go WAY DOWN,but we will just have to see where things go,but I think in the far future,OR MAYBE not so distant future/ our next evolutionary step is a moneyless society/socialism/a fully autonomous world,how this plays out/works exactly,is yet to be determined,granted we DEFINITELY don't need to get to lazy/we should still be doing things,but A LOT of people are DEFINITELY going to feel like,they will never be good enough/they could never compete with AI/Robots; Humans will NEED to find other purposes,I also wouldn't be surprised to see a resistance type group/extremist group,that try to damage/destroy servers/robots/AI/equipment,at some point,I know that sounds crazy,but if people's purpose/lively hoods/jobs/income are in jeopardy and they don't see a solution,fear/anger or both MAY take over,in some people.

What do you think humans will realize/what conclusion do you think humans will come to, regarding this?

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this?

You need to keep in mind,what we are seeing is just whats available to the general public, when it comes to AI,company's/corporation's/government will have AI that is MUCH MORE capable,also A LOT of OpenAI/GPT is dumbed down, so server resources aren't over whelmed and for legal purposes/so AI isn't as harmful to society and also so these companies don't get sued as much OR shut down entirely.

Also generational wealth,if not replinished,will not last forever.

Also warehouses can run fully autonomously now too,Autonomous vehichles with Lidar,GPS and cameras are very capable too.

Robots that move items around are available now too.

It is designed for material-handling applications, and features a manipulator arm capable of picking up heavy boxes,handle uses a swinging ""tail"" to counterbalance the weight of its arm, when it is holding a heavy box;SuperPick Polybag Picking System is a robotic solution designed by Soft Robotics Inc,the system is intended to enable e-commerce operations to automate the handling, scanning, and loading of outbound orders and returns,Starship Technologies make autonomous delivery robots,which are six-wheeled ground robots that can navigate streets and sidewalks autonomously. They are designed to be safe and robust, offering on-demand package delivery for consumers and businesses. Some have said the robots look like beer coolers,most likely this assessment came from young college kids,since currently that is where the robot/company makes most of their deliveries/this is where most of their business is carried out, on college campuses;Starship Technologies,robots can deliver a variety of items. They are currently available to deliver items on college campuses around the world, where they can deliver food, drinks, office stationery and tools. They are designed to make food and package deliveries more efficient, convenient and sustainable.



,Kiwi,Robo Mart,TeleRetail,Scout Robot,are examples of autonomous mobile robot stores; Construction robots/companies like BAUBOT,OKIBO,Hilti JAIBOT,Dusty Robotics,ULC Robotics,Built Robotics are available now as well; Also medical robots like The da Vinci Surgical Robot,also other companies like Edge Innovations, ABB Ltd,FANUC,Epson,KUKA,Staubli,just to name a few.

A LOT of jobs/workers are becoming obsolete/cashiers,warehouse workers/line workers,construction workers/the self driving field is accomplishing A LOT right now too/Elon Musk,is missing a key component/technology, and thats lidar;Also the U.S. military has had autonomous planes for decades,so pilots are Becoming obsolete as well.

A LOT can be prepped at night for construction workers/machines can be ran at night, also window installing and cleaning bots are a thing now as well.

Also autonomous agricultural bots/robots are a thing now as well.

Drs MAY become obsolete as well/their jobs could/will eventually be taken over by AI/ bots/bots ALREADY do A LOT of surgery, such as Coronary artery bypass ,cutting away cancer tissue from sensitive parts of the body ,such as blood vessels, nerves, or important body organs,Gallbladder removal, Hip Replacement, Hysterectomy,Kidney removal, kidney transplant,Mitral Valve Repair,Pyeloplasty ,surgery to correct ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Pyloroplasty,Radical Prostatectomy,Radical cystectomy,Tubal ligation.


This is happening more and more NOW too, Brick and Mortar is some what going away/ more stores will either close and open up a distribution center or become a distribution center, door dash will handle that, AND AT SOME POINT, Door Dash will be FULLY AUTONOMOUS as well/the vehicles will be self driving and robots will load and unload the vehicles, Door Dash MAY NOT be the ending company/the only company doing this, BUT a company/companies will be doing this.


Probably SOON employees that unload trucks, stock shelves, truck drivers, should go next, because of self driving vehicles and arms, connected to vehicles, which will drop the package out, once the vehicles in position or an autonomous drone or some other type of robot, will make the delivery.

Also think about how much a human can lift, if lucky, you MIGHT get one that can lift 250 pounds, a robot could lift 1000pounds, robots don't need breaks, as often/they can charge up, while another one replaces them, they don't get paid/need money, they don't get sick,they don't have feelings or rights/its a machine, so basically its easier to deal with,also at some point they will be fixing them selves; Or another bot/robot,will fix/maintain/repair and so on,other robots/EVENTUALLY they will be able to fix them selfs or another bot will aid in repairing them/other robots.


Electricians MIGHT be okay, well, MAYBE for a little while, I mean think about it, how hard is it, to see colors/distinguish green/ground,White/Neutral,Red and black/hot/a camera paired with AI or even just IFTTT and a camera,could handle that, also electricians ALREADY consult machines/voltage meters, to diagnose problems/figure things out/ALL of that could be on a machine/bot and be handled MUCH quicker/more efficiently/effectively, with a bot.

Auto mechanics MAY be the next to go, especially if bots, could get in tight places easier/sync with the whole car/have a diagnostic reader on board, lift an entire engine/the whole car, on its own/vehicles are already assembled by robots/vehicle manufacturing plants use robots for,painting, welding, assembly, and material handling,ALREADY/An average car has about 30,000 parts. Once those parts are manufactured and brought to the final production line, it takes companie's robots about 18 to 35 hours to produce one mass-market vehicle, from welding to full engine assembly to painting, another example of all of this is Tesla/ to meet Tesla's uncompromising production goals, Musk settled on an equally uncompromising production strategy, full automation, no ifs, ands or buts. The goal was to remove every single human operator and only stop when the facility looked like an alien spaceship,according to musk/these are musks words.

This is a semi comprehensive list of obsolete jobs/fields right now,that are obsolete,eventually everyone will be obsolete though,at least in the sense that a robot can do your job better than you can,from a practical stand point;

Machines/robots/Automation/AI could easily ruine/destroy the economy/push society/people/humans to a moneyless society/to socialism or force people to revert back,or become more self reliant/people would need to raise their own farm animals,grow their own plants/make their own clothes/things/trade may be needed more as well,the honest truth is,all of these companies are putting them selfs out of business as well/they probably think that,if they don't release Chat GPT/a GPT/AI competitor,they will fall behind/become obsolete as a company,but at the same time, NO ONE will have any money to buy services/products,so no one can pay for a subscription and ad revenue won't work,because no one will have money to buy products,so theres no point in advertising,also rich people's money/generational wealth only lasts so long,if its not replenished, also honestly every employee/human hired,is a potential profit/those employees will purchase your products,if not yours,someone elses employee will purchase your products,IF your products are in demand,if there not in demand,you have a bigger problem,than people not having money to buy your products,Machines/AI/Robots don't need your products and these machines also have to be purchased by companie owners/it might sound appealing right now,to spend one minimum wagers yearly earnings on a machine,that can replace all of your hired employees, but EVENTUALLY if everyone's replaced and rich people's/generational wealth runs out,you will no longer be able to sell your products,because no one has money to buy them, obviously eventually it will be all jobs,at least until rich people/business owners realize this and decide humans are the better investment,but heres the list for right now, of jobs that will be going away/jobs that are obsolete.

2023-08-09T07:22:20Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"Obviously we want to be as safe as possible with this technology,but we wouldn't have planes today,if we didn't continue to create/use/optimize planes, and look how safe plane travel is today,its just a matter of time,before this is perfected as well.


TuSimple,is one good example of self driving semi trucks; it uses Lidar,radar,cameras and GPS,to achieve this,Kodiak Robotics,is another company/example of this technology,Volvo also has this type of technology as well,Walmart/Gatik also have fully autonomous delivery trucks as well,also other companies have this technology, such as Embark, PlusAI, Einride,Waabi,Locomation,Torc Robotics, Aurora,Outrider and IKE,just to name a few. 


Heres a list of truck fleet operators,that have been open about their pursuit of autonomous driving technology, Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX), J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), and Schneider National (SNDR),also delivery services such as DHL, FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) are also working with autonomous trucking firms.


These were things that were brought up by truck drivers, that truck drivers thought weren't possible;




TuSimple is a company that develops self-driving trucks. These trucks use a combination of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. The data from these sensors is fed into the truck’s computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to anticipate and avoid accidents. For example, the truck can detect when another vehicle is getting too close and automatically apply the brakes or take evasive action to avoid a collision.


Vans/SUVs have automatic doors/parking garage doors can go up and down automatically/my garage door goes up and down,autonomously,so having automatic trailer doors,wouldn't be that hard to achieve.


Automatic refueling, is a technology that allows autonomous vehicles to refuel without human intervention. This technology involves routing the vehicle to an available fueling station. At the fueling station, a robotic arm is used to connect the vehicle to the fuel pump and refuel it automatically; Although some or eventually maybe all trucks/vehicles MAY be electric, in the future,with solar,they MAY even also use some type of wind turbine,to generate power as well and batteries will also continue to improve/lithium batteries MAY/PROBABLY will be replaced by a type of battery thats MUCH better.


When it comes to deploying triangles. Warning triangles are typically used by human drivers to alert other motorists of a stopped or disabled vehicle. Since autonomous trucks are designed to operate without human intervention, they can send information to all near by autonomous vehicles,about thier presence,they can also use other methods to alert other motorists of their presence, such as flashing lights or warning signals/with less humans in the equation,less problems will occur anyway/EVERYTHING will be calculated,no road rage will be in the equation,nor any emotion,also even vehicles that aren't fully autonomous now days,have driver assist,to prevent humans from causing accidents,so that driver assist technology/on board computers/communication, could also receive this information,allowing it to handle the problem and also maybe alerting the human of the trucks presents as well.


LEDs are A LOT less likely to burn out,compared to incandescent bulbs/halogen bulbs.


Also vehicles can be built/assembled/manufactured,fully autonomously now days, so I don't see why vehicles couldn't also be repaired autonomously. An autonomous tow truck,can take the vehicle in for automatic repair/meaning soon auto mechanics won't be needed either.


Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to detect and react to their surroundings. These sensors can also be used to detect weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. The data from these sensors is fed into the vehicle’s computer system, which uses advanced algorithms to interpret the data and make decisions based on the current weather conditions. For example, if the sensors detect that it is raining, the vehicle may slow down or activate its windshield wipers, to improve visibility,this is just one example/a self driving system can interpret A LOT of data/information all at once,it can also see a long way down the road/it has the ability to see things humans wouldn't always see,with lidar and cameras and its constantly getting traffic updates as well,to know whats up ahead as well,also other autonomous vehicles can also relay this type of crucial information to other autonomous vehicles that are in proximity as well.


Circle Checks aren't really needed,because cameras can constantly be on certain parts of the vehicle,at all times,sensors are also in place,to detect malfunctions,also other autonomous vehicles can relay info like this as well,if it passes by other autonomous vehicles,it can send info about the problem,also leaving a gas cap open or not closing something all the way, is usually a human error,so certain things like this,wouldn't even be a problem and the more the systems and hardware gets optimized, within autonomous trucks,the more efficient/effective autonomous trucks will become/chains/ropes/the things that hold things down,should have sensors on them,to make sure they are secured properly and cameras can also see and interpret information about this as well.


Autonomous vehicles use and can use a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar and other automatic trailer locking and unlocking features,to perform a trailer switch.


When it comes to snow chains,SOME examples of automatic chains are Onspot and Rotogrip.


Companies have created fully automatic cleaning systems, for the sensors on self-driving trucks too. These systems typically use retractable liquid-jet nozzles that spray a precise amount of cleaning fluid (stored in an onboard reservoir) onto the sensor lens or face, also included, is a drying and de-icing heater as well.",2023-08-09T07:22:20Z
2023-08-09T07:23:19Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"I have a comprehensive guide/plan to all of this,but it cant be uploaded as a comment,because its to long,so this is the condensed/shorter version.

This is humanities next evolutionary step/steps,anything other than a moneyless,autonomous world/society,would be a sign of us devolving/going backwards;


These things are also crucial to avoid,in the mean time, we don't need to kill our selfs,with war or by not taking care of our planet or by humans not being an interstellar species/a natural disaster is less likely to wipe out a species, that are on more than one planet or multiple planets,but at the same time,we also don't need to make the same mistakes we've made on this planet/earth/we need to learn to take care of planets,before we populate another one,but most likely we are going to be on another planet,before we learn that lesson/start making better decisions in that department,like I said,if we don't kill ourselves with war first,this is the route we need to be going;


We still don't know who will be in charge,but hopefully the voting systems,for laws,regulations and people that are in power,will stay the same and the same rules will stay some what the same,so their power is limited/only reaches so far/even the president now,can't do absolutely anything he wants,which is a good thing,I'm not saying corrupt things don't happen,because they do,but the current system is implemented,to prevent individuals that are in power,from doing absolutely anything they want and these people were also elected by the people,so HOPEFULLY that also means something,but we still don't know if government or corporations will be running things,MOST LIKELY,the government will make sure they remain the enforcers,but time will tell.

The development of advanced AI systems and automation raises important considerations and challenges. While the evolution of AI and automation is predictable, the implementation of a moneyless society and the division of individuals/fairness/implication management, will have some difficult hurdles to over come,but Its possible that certain individuals, such as presidents, governors, regulators and consultants/experts in many different fields, could be considered more valuable and receive more items vs other people. However, it is crucial to carefully determine the criteria for evaluating the value of individuals and prevent the concentration of power or the creation of unjust hierarchies.

Unintended consequences should also be carefully evaluated and mitigated, as changes to complex systems can have far-reaching effects. Just as ecological changes can disrupt natural balances, just as killing off one species, could cause another species to become over populated and kill off another species, because the species we killed off, ate that species and without the species we killed,that species could kill off another species,because that species was over populating. 

Just like that type scenario, major shifts in economic systems and social structures can also have complex and interconnected impacts. Therefore, any transition or transformation should be approached with comprehensive analysis, consideration of feedback from experts, and ongoing evaluation to minimize negative consequences.

To address these challenges, a broad outline for a plan is listed below, but it requires revision and optimization,CONSTANTLY/variables are CONSTANTLY being added to the equation,that could cause A LOT of problems,if the plan is not evaluated and optimized,CONSTANTLY. The plan includes defining the vision and goals of a moneyless society, developing AI regulation and laws, ensuring AI and automation responsiveness, designing resource allocation mechanisms, addressing social value, establishing enforcement mechanisms, planning for ecological sustainability, and continuously evaluating and adapting the system.

In terms of job roles that may be in demand, some positions would focus on evaluating and optimizing economies, providing consultancy services, managing risks, promoting sustainability, fostering innovation, facilitating entrepreneurship, and assessing social impact. These roles would contribute to economic stability and ensure equitable distribution of benefits from AI/automation/machines/robots. Additionally, roles related to new/optimized technology development and scientific discoveries would remain valuable, and they will continually introduce new variables into the system as well.

It is important to remember that while AI systems excel in certain areas, human oversight is essential for empathy, subjective judgment, and ethical decision-making. Comprehensive regulations and governance are necessary to guide AI development and deployment while considering ethics, privacy, transparency, bias, and accountability. Engaging experts and involving the wider community in the decision-making processes is crucial for developing effective regulations and aligning outcomes with societal values.

In conclusion, while AI can automate basically all tasks and AI is WAY MORE efficient compared to humans,humans are still needed for things like, human judgment and ethical consideration, which are necessary to evaluate broader implications and make decisions in the best interest of society. Responsible AI integration requires ongoing evaluation, monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community involvement. Hearing others' perspectives and thoughts on these matters is valuable for fostering a comprehensive and inclusive approach to this new world/society.",2023-08-09T07:23:19Z
2023-08-09T07:23:44Z,@mattmatt2417,GtVsVuCeZSM,"When it comes to current AI regulation,which is basically non existent,but all of this should evolve over time,but here are some organizations, that COULD be responsible for AI regulation:

The Federal Trade Commission/the FTC, The Federal Trade Commission,is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for protecting consumers and promoting competition. While the FTC's primary focus is on enforcing antitrust laws and preventing unfair business practices, it also plays a role in regulating aspects related to Machine Learning and AI.

One aspect of this, is Consumer Protection: The FTC ensures that consumers are not deceived or harmed by deceptive or unfair AI-driven practices. This includes cases where machine learning algorithms are used for targeted advertising, personalized pricing, or automated decision-making,some could argue,the FTC isn't doing enough,but this is their job none the less.

Another aspect the FTC deals with, is Data Privacy: The FTC addresses privacy concerns related to AI applications, that involve the collection and processing of personal data. It enforces privacy regulations and takes action against organizations that fail to protect user data adequately.

Another thing the FTC is supposed to handle is, Algorithmic Bias: The FTC is concerned about algorithmic bias in AI systems that may lead to discriminatory outcomes. It monitors instances where AI algorithms may perpetuate biases based on race, gender, or other sensitive attributes.

Another task the FTC is supposed to hande is Enforcement Actions, In cases of AI misuse, the FTC can initiate enforcement actions against companies or organizations that violate consumer protection or privacy laws.

Another organization that can/could handle AI issues,is The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,for short:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. NIST's role in the context of AI and machine learning involves developing standards, guidelines, and best practices to support innovation, security, and interoperability in AI technologies.

When it comes to AI Standards, NIST works on developing technical standards and guidelines to address the challenges of AI technologies. This includes standards for data formats, model interoperability, and performance evaluation.

Another aspect that NIST is supposed to handle/could handle,is AI Security, NIST focuses on ensuring the security of AI systems. It develops guidelines for secure AI development and deployment to protect against cyber threats and potential vulnerabilities.

Another responsibility that NIST has is Explainable AI,NIST researches and promotes techniques for making AI systems more transparent and interpretable. It aims to improve the understanding of AI's decision-making processes.

Another role NIST plays is AI Evaluation and Testing, NIST creates evaluation frameworks and test datasets to benchmark AI models performance, promoting fair comparisons among different approaches.

Another organisation, that can/is helping in AI development,is The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,the OECD; The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization comprising 38 member countries, dedicated to promoting policies that foster economic growth and well-being. In the context of AI, the OECD has developed principles and guidelines to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The work that the OECD does around AI Principles, focuses on promoting AI systems that are inclusive, transparent, and that respect human rights. They emphasize the importance of accountability, fairness, and human-centric design in AI technologies.

When it comes to Policy Recommendations: The OECD provides policy recommendations to member countries and the global community, to support the ethical use of AI. These recommendations encourage the establishment of legal frameworks and international cooperation on AI governance.

The OECD's Interdisciplinary Approach: Takes an interdisciplinary approach, while collaborating with experts from various fields, including ethics, economics, and law, to develop comprehensive guidelines for AI governance.

The United Nations,also known as the UN,is an international organization established to promote global cooperation and address global challenges. In the context of AI, the UN focuses on the ethical and human rights aspects of AI technologies.

When it comes to AI and Human Rights: The UN addresses the potential impact of AI on human rights, ensuring that AI systems respect and protect individuals rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination.

When it comes to the UN's approach on AI Sustainable Development: The UN explores how AI can be harnessed to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as improving healthcare, education, and environmental protection.

When it comes to the UN's promotion of Global Cooperation:The UN encourages international cooperation on AI governance, sharing best practices and addressing cross-border challenges associated with AI development and deployment.

When it comes to the UN's approach on Ethical AI Development: Discussions on ethical AI development, encouraging stakeholders to consider the broader societal implications of AI technologies,is one good way of helping these problems get resolved.

By understanding these organizations, roles and focusing on areas related to AI and machine learning, one can appreciate the global efforts to ensure responsible, ethical, and secure development and deployment of AI technologies, for the benefit of society. These organizations contribute to establishing guidelines and standards that address the challenges and potential risks of AI, while promoting its positive impact on various aspects of life and industry,obviously these organizations will need to evolve to handle these situations and a new regulatory organization, MAY need to form, as well,so that AI can be their primary focus,so its easier to handle all of these situations that will and are coming from AI.",2023-08-09T07:23:44Z

Again;  People are definitely naive and over confident. Only a few outcomes can come from the implementation of Machines/Robots/Automation/AI.

One: a world where no jobs are available to humans and a moneyless society/Socialism would be implemented/a system where items were divide out/divided out. 

Two: We revert back to our old ways/by being more self sufficient/sustainable/by raising livestock/growing food/by trading goods and services.

Three: humans/business owners realize/come to the conclusion that there is no money in machines/robots/automation/AI/it sounds good right now to pay/invest just one of your minimum wage employees salary for one year, to obtain an AI robot that can replace all of your current employees,but what will be realized is,if no one has jobs/money,no one will have money to pay for your product/subscriptions/ad revenue/what you are selling/every employee hired,is a potential profit/that employee or someone elses employee MAY buy your product/employees are good investments.

Four: AI becomes self aware/a skynet/terminator scenario/outcome,becomes humans reality/AI/Robots try to take out humans or like in IRobot, the AI realizes,to preserve humans/to follow all of the robots rules, a few humans need to be taken out,because humans are over populating earth and not using renewable energy and they are not trying to keep/create a smaller carbon foot print/all humans arent trying to be eco friendly,so to save humans,some of the population of humans need to be taken out. 



The only jobs AI/robots create, is AI regulation jobs and FOR NOW,these machines/AI will PROBABLY need to be built/programmed/updated/maintained, by humans,FOR NOW and this also depends on the route taken by these companies/cars can be built autonomously,so it wouldn't be to surprising,to see robots/AI being built/maintained fully autonomously/A LOT of things can be automated, even now/in todays day and time and DEFINITELY in the future, but the question is,will companies see the value in the investment of humans/this may not be seen right away/it may take time for companies to realize, money comes from humans,not robots,either way,even now, the need/demand for people/humans are going to go WAY DOWN,but we will just have to see where things go,but I think in the far future,OR MAYBE not so distant future/ our next evolutionary step is a moneyless society/socialism/a fully autonomous world,how this plays out/works exactly,is yet to be determined,granted we DEFINITELY don't need to get to lazy/we should still be doing things,but A LOT of people are DEFINITELY going to feel like,they will never be good enough/they could never compete with AI/Robots; Humans will NEED to find other purposes,I also wouldn't be surprised to see a resistance type group/extremist group,that try to damage/destroy servers/robots/AI/equipment,at some point,I know that sounds crazy,but if people's purpose/lively hoods/jobs/income are in jeopardy and they don't see a solution,fear/anger or both MAY take over,in some people.

What do you think humans will realize/what conclusion do you think humans will come to, regarding this?

What do you think the outcome will be with all of this?

You need to keep in mind,what we are seeing is just whats available to the general public, when it comes to AI,company's/corporation's/government will have AI that is MUCH MORE capable,also A LOT of OpenAI/GPT is dumbed down, so server resources aren't over whelmed and for legal purposes/so AI isn't as harmful to society and also so these companies don't get sued as much OR shut down entirely.

Also generational wealth,if not replinished,will not last forever.

Also warehouses can run fully autonomously now too,Autonomous vehichles with Lidar,GPS and cameras are very capable too.

But i guess you have to consider an artist often produces just one or a few marbles in his career and a thousand pieces of mediocre art. I think spotify is the best example of the possibility AI already has. Most of the music released today, follows the rules of algorithms, determining the style of music. E.g. a song shouldn't be longer than 3 minutes and you have to play the refrain before the first 30 seconds are over. Following those guidelines AI won't be able to write the best song of the Top 100 Charts but it will be able to produce the other 99 songs automated. Same thing with Art and with Writing.

You then had the rabid push in early January 2023 at the WEF where the narrative was pushed out for all media and business to “talk about Ai.” Tech bros lost so much money in 2022 they needed bailed out, and the propaganda has been incredible thick with Ai bluster. I guarantee you Ai is going to flop just as 5G and blockchain were complete flops. Neither have changed a damn thing.

All of these “advancements” in Ai were products/services already on the market. They just repackaged them and called it “Ai.” Somehow chatbots are this incredible tool when in reality we’ve had them for years and everyone was annoyed using them. Now it’s suddenly “Ai” and people pretend like a chatbot querying Google and plucking biased data is some profound leap in technology. I also hear programmers brag about what used to be known as debugging and autocomplete. Somehow that’s profound even though it’s existed for many years. 

Remember, 5G was supposed to change everything. I don’t even use 5G on my phone. Speeds aren’t a tenth of what they promised. 

Remember, Bitcoin/blockchain was supposed to change everything. Outside of rampant speculation, it costs a fortune to use Bitcoin in everyday transactions to pay the miners to process/solve, and it takes 45 minutes! The Visa card network processes thousands of transactions a second!

So, just as 5G and blockchain haven’t changed anything and are just marginal advances (even though blockchain as a concept is decades old), Ai is just that. Overhyped marginal gains in technology that has been going on for years. They brand it “Ai” and people lose the ability to critically think.

It’s amazing to see people enamored by Chatbots. I guess the biggest risk of Ai isn’t what it will do to us, but how people mistake Ai for what it isn’t. I genuinely think people are so mentally fragile they’ll gravitate to Ai and ascribe oracle-like properties to it, and will seek out Ai like some wise teacher, when all it is is a worse version of Wikipedia, which Wikipedia is already bad enough.",2024-05-05T12:11:42Z

日本ではテスラ(tesla)のドライバーのほとんどがテスラ車🚙を愛しています。みんな情報交換して楽しく乗っています。素晴らしい乗り物🚘️です。走りは最高の快適性がある。充電するのも面倒ではなく、遊び心で楽しんでいるようです。デザインも性能も素晴らしいし、自律運転がほぼ実現しているし、電気エネルギーの供給サービス網も整備して収益化していて、世界の温暖化対策にも取り組み、テスラ製品はアップルのスマートフォン📱のように、愛されてたくさんのテスラファンがいる。ロボットもfigure01よりもセクシーなデザインだし、異様な驚異をかんじさせる@openAIは不気味さを感じてしまう。生成AIも不気味の谷にいて、現実生活と乖離して奇妙な映像や動きを作り出してしまっている。しかし、テスラの技術は人間の生活様式を改善しようとしていて、真に有用な製品化を目指して収益化が計画的に実行中であると考えられます。
それなのに、EVの価格が少し下がっただけで中国との競争を不安に思わせるニュースを聞いて、株安にされ、個人投資家が焦って投げ売りしてしまい、短期的な目線で売買を繰り返し、Elon Muskの長期的な戦略的思考に着いていけず、損ばかりしている。まさに、短期は損気。
なぜ、テスラのOptimusやEnergyやCyberTruckの魅力を忘れて売ってしまうのだろうか？　機関投資家はなぜ目標株価を下げることに理解が得られるのだろうか？　みんなテスラの魅力や長期間の未実現の巨大な収益に気づかないでいるのは、逆に貴重で素晴らしい、投資家人生一番のBig opportunity が今🎉だと確信している。下がれ株価💹",2024-04-07T01:01:36Z

Artificial intelligence is driving exponential growth across multiple innovation platforms.
Convergence of technologies like AI, robotics, energy storage, blockchain, and sequencing is changing growth dynamics significantly.
Expectations for sustained growth have historically been doubted but have been proven possible, as seen with companies like Amazon.
Generative AI is leading to exponential growth, with costs dropping rapidly, fueling opportunities for explosive growth.
Autonomous taxi platforms are just one example of convergence, poised to create a multi-trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.
Predictions suggest global GDP growth could accelerate to six to nine percent, driven by productivity gains from AI and converging technologies.
The future holds potential for significant wealth creation through productivity gains, impacting profits, wages, and prices.
Despite current concerns about inflation, there's a belief in an impending deflationary period due to innovation enhancing margins and lowering prices.
Disruptive innovation, fueled by convergence, is poised to scale dramatically, with potential valuation reaching over 200 trillion dollars.
Creative destruction accompanies disruptive innovation, transforming industries such as transportation, healthcare, finance, and property rights.
Confidence in these forecasts stems from ongoing research and breakthroughs in AI, reinforcing conviction in the potential for significant change and opportunity.",2024-03-31T09:44:33Z

Laying off workers due to productivity gains means those workers spend less while out of work, some companies will certainly make big gains, lower costs, higher margins, but unseen second and third order effects have yet to be accounted for. The major second order effect of the early 1900's was WW1. We are also dealing with falling birth rates, greater number of retirees living of savings. In the 1900's you had huge labour forces coming off farms with families of 8-12 children. Not this time.

2023-12-19T23:58:22Z,@yapdog,rQEh7d-qa38,"Say you have 2 employees, Paul and Joe. They both do the same job that requires a lot of mental work. Paul starts using AI to make some of these task easier, taking less time. Soon he's able to complete his work in fraction of the time, and take on some of Joe's workload. Over time, Paul relies more and more on AI to the point where you have no need for Joe. *_Why in the world would any employer in his right mind keep Joe on the payroll?_* Especially in a system that tends to reward companies for reducing payroll (publicly traded companies). 

Okay, people like Cathie Wood would argue that your company can produce more if Joe is kept on. Not all jobs are in the direct production pipeline. Some jobs fall under management and administration and support. Further, producing more doesn't work in all business models or markets, and is no guarantee of success.

Joe will be out of a job, plain and simple. And so, too, will Paul as employers would be able to outsource more tasks to AI services. Paul and Joe may be able to do one-off jobs on such a service... but at a *significant* reduction in income, requiring them to find supplemental work... if they can.

So, if anyone tries to sell you on the idea that wages and opportunities will increase with AI, examine the source. _Thoroughly._",2023-12-19T23:59:53Z

Basically what I'm trying to say here is that while there is vast economic potential (and an equal amount of potential in other domains) AI is serviced by a very highly specialized chain of industries (ex. Rare earth mining, electricity production, etc), and so if a single one of those fails, all of the potential of AI tech also fails (it's not robust).

People may point out that this chain of industry necessities has existed for a long time, but with AI it's the linear scaling of the resources that is a structural limitation of its adoption for me",2024-01-01T01:19:14Z

2023-12-19T15:24:55Z,@crawkn,rQEh7d-qa38,"The fallacies of rapid growth being destabilizing in a negative way are related to the fundamental fallacy of labor productivity. Productivity is far more a function of technology, powered by harvested energy, than of human labor, powered by food calories. Expressing productivity in terms of human labor hours is nonsense, although the variability between labor-based productivity in high-tech nations versus low-tech nations does illustrate the huge advantages of application of energy _in place of_ human labor.

The primary factor leading to economic instability is consumer credit, and the secondary factor is failure to proactively manage availability of resources. Economic growth doesn't necessarily correlate with resource consumption, where technology allows for more efficient use of resources. But where resource supply issues create bottlenecks, economic growth is retarded.

So the solutions to a cyclical economy are:  a) use credit for production rather than consumption;  b) rely on clean energy and technology _applied efficiently_ to substitute for human labor; and c) anticipate resource supply bottlenecks, and meet them in advance.

Then the next challenge is figuring out how consumer products can be allocated effectively when labor is in oversupply. Here the problem is not the availability of viable solutions, but the reticence of humans to accept novel economic models.",2023-12-19T15:26:59Z

This is the destruction of capitalism in the making. She’s stoked because she’s already rich with plenty of money to invest in the few big winners to get even more rich (which she probably knows she needs to prep for the collapse). But when this goes far enough and everyone is on unemployment, then they can’t find a job for an entire year, then the unemployment money stops coming in, what then!? We all just become homeless and die? What a BS presentation! We need to redistribute the wealth with universal basic income ASAP. The job market is already flooding. Starting one year from now and then worse every year, millions of overqualified people will have no job opportunities, and just die on the streets if the rich keep giving us this BS narrative. 

Shame on TED for this. The people deserve the TRUTH and governments need to start working on a serious plan to transition to a post-labor system. Their precious stocks collapse too if most people don’t have jobs to even pay for anything. Then the big bank run will cause the total collapse of society and send us into a Great Depression where everyone is killing each other to survive. 

But let’s just pretend like that’s not going to happen and promote businesses as usual while we all use AI to replace all the jobs with no UBI plan. Greed will be our downfall. What a shame. I sure hope the leaders pull their heads out soon enough. 

If the wealthy would all just become philanthropists we could seriously potentially transition smoothly to a post-labor utopia. Capitalism would be dead, our lives would be simpler, but they would be great without work. Capitalism needs to end anyway. It will kill us even if the AI collapse doesn’t. We need the plot of iRobot to happen but instead of us locking them up at the end, we let them take our jobs and save us with free essentials gifted by the rich to sustain the human race.

the strength of nations like the US lies in its share of the global wealth. the appropriation of the majority of the world’s capital by the 1% would spell the death of democracy, and the reign of autocracy. this is an actual causal link in the field of comparative political science- democracies only occur in nations where the middle class is large, and do not occur in nations with a minute middle class (aka a more disproportionate distribution of capital). middle class income has been stagnant for years in the US, while the wealth of the 1% has grown exponentially. is this exponential economic growth truly for all, or for the corporate bureaucrat giving this talk?",2023-12-18T23:57:26Z

then production itself would essentially only take place for the benefit of the 1% who own those machines, unless a UBI is established, or we decide that there is no need for them to own those machines anymore and make them public. the first one is a capitalist solution since it maintains private ownership, the second is a socialist solution since it makes the means of production socially owned. 

a third semi-capitalist solution would be to regulate the use of AI globally, forcing companies to employ a quota of human workers over artificial intelligence. this somehow is the most unrealistic of the three; i highly doubt every country would agree to this, since the incentive for global power gains from allowing AI technology to thrive within domestic corporations would be far too strong. those companies would be able to gain a huge portion of global market share due to their much cheaper price for goods.",2023-12-19T01:05:55Z

She simultaneously said she believes wages will go up while also highlighting the robotaxi revolution, brought on by autonomous driving that will literally wipe out millions of jobs. Sure, that traditionally increases wages for the working class 🙄 

And she’s giddy about this. She can barely contain her excitement. 

I love tech and can’t deny that this sci fi world we’re living in right now isn’t really cool. But these people are sociopaths, completely hollow shells with zero empathetic capacity. 

Can a better world emerge from this? Sure it can. But the wreckage along the way will be devastating. 

Try a “pull yourself up by your bootstraps”, “manifest greatness through positivity” mindset when AI and automation can literally do whatever you can do 100x faster and better, while also being 1000x cheaper. 

These attitudes are helpful in societies and countries where opportunity exists. 

You could use that positive energy and AI to build you a business and then what? Sell your products and services to the unemployed masses who have no way of generating income? 

What is she and people like Marc Andreessen talking about increased wages? Increased productivity only increases wages when you need people  for the increased productivity. In this instance, the increased productivity is literally due to the fact that AI and automation will be able to do what humans do better, faster, and cheaper.

Yes, the data still has to be verified from its source which is why digital identity systems are needed, luckily we already have those systems in place that complement it like kyc and novel solutions like worldcoin. The point is the data itself can't be altered in public whereas its integrity has the potential to be altered with private databases.

All sorts of compromising and illegal data can be added to blockchain with absolutely no way to remove it. A disgruntled employee leaks his boss's private data, and there is nothing anyone can do about it apart from adding another entry that says 'please, disregard'.

Is it making kids able to solve problem, focusing on the product (e.g. the correct solution of an equation)? Or is it helping kids developing the mathematical thinking? in the example provided the ""AI personal assistant"" points out to the correct application of a rule (distributing the factor to the numbers inside the parenthesis). However there is no help in uderstanding the ""WHY"" of such a rule. I would think that a good teacher should help stundents UNDERSTANDING why such a rule exists, working on their high level thinking skills, rather than focusing (only?) on their ability of remembering and applying a rule...but then again I am not so familiar with the Khan Academy so maybe that kind of thinking is developed in other parts of their math programme?",2024-05-04T08:36:54Z

They assume that students have learned something because they type in the correct response to a prompt.  The only thing students will learn is how to give AI  the answer it wants - just enough of an answer to stop further prompts and get the little winner's cup emoji.

2023-10-31T03:00:45Z,@Sparrowthorn,hJP5GqnTrNo,"A very clear and compelling talk, as you'd expect from Sal Khan. While I'm ""all in"" on the Math, I find the Jay Gatsby example a little troubling. When a student is able to ""ask Jay Gatsby"" (the Khanmigo ""bot"") the significance of the green light on Daisy's dock then when it replies, posing as ""Jay Gatsby"", it's just spoon-feeding an answer. The student has not had to figure anything out for herself which in the arts is critical (just as much as in math). 

Why? Because reading a work of literature is an act of ""co-creation"" between writer and reader. When we read ""Gatsby"", each of us forms our own Jay Gatsby in our minds conjured by the magic Fitzgerald's words, coupled with the work of our own (unique) imagination. This is what gives art its power.

Khan's bot, however, is serving up a kind of Big Mac version of Gatsby (lots of ""old sports"" and not much else). The student's interactions with this fake (lightweight) version of the character are by definition superficial. She's not engaging in the infinitely more rewarding act of imaginative creation, in the company of a great writer. As a result her impression of the book is likely to be shaped by the bot, and not by Fitzgerald.

Last point—I'm OK with this if it's just ""training wheels""...getting kids over the first hurdle in reading a work of literature (one that they'd probably not read without the assistance of the bot). But once the student gets some momentum, they should be encouraged—and in a school setting, required—to switch off the tech, otherwise they'll be short-changed.",2023-10-31T03:00:45Z

Students eventually grow up, have to find jobs, support families, pay rents, utilities, healthcare etc. But how many employees top 10 tech companies would really need eventually? Will the minimum wage salaries be enough for rest of the population? How many can be lucky to get donations from Gates foundation? How many will be motivated in creating startups focused on going beyond Mars? How many students will be motivated to learn any complex subject knowing fully well they can't afford a middle class living standard even if they grind for rest of their lives.

o  The speaker argues that AI can be used to enhance education rather than undermine it if the proper safeguards and regulations are put in place.
o  AI tutors and teaching assistants can give every student a personalized tutor and every teacher an AI assistant. This could help address the ""two sigma problem"" of improving student outcomes.
o  The speaker shows examples of an AI called Khanmigo helping students learn math, coding, literature, and writing. It provides tailored feedback and encouragement.
o  Khanmigo can also be used by teachers to help create lesson plans, grade assignments, and prepare to teach new topics. This could save teachers a lot of time currently spent on administrative tasks.
o  While some are optimistic or pessimistic about AI, the speaker argues we should take an active role in ensuring it's developed and applied responsibly. If we pause progress out of fear, others may accelerate their AI for negative uses.

Say- if we were to ask the AI to grade a whole student body, a school for example- on a piece of creative writing- how would the grades received by the students from the AI, correlate with the grades between different teachers. What would that tell us about the AI and the teachers? 
How would we make an optimal ""marking"" machine, while improving ourselves by using it?
How do we even begin to decide what a ""statistical anomaly is"", when the question is no longer- concensus, but optimization. 

The obvious answer is trial and error, but the thing you are playing with here- education, is not unimportant. In fact, if the ""error"" part goes really wrong, that's a recipe for apocalypse.

How many developing nations have schools, even Universities, with constant internet talk less of access to Khanmigo? 

Kudos to you, developed countries can utilise this and keep being developed while developing countries try to sort themselves out. 

Within those developing countries, it is mostly the upper middle class and upper class that would be able to access and utilise such technologies at the start and for a good period of time, leaving behind the majority of the masses. 

I do not want a world where only the privileged have access to good quality education.

The demo showed that it could be helpful with basic academic planning but to take the place of a quality counselor requires empathy and sentience that AI doesn't have (and will never have) though I think it can be a helpful tool for counselors in managing their high case loads. Also could be helpful with writing individualized assessment plans for students with disabilities, there is a huge national shortage that backlogs thousands of cases.

Unfortunately he's quite wrong when it comes to the last couple minutes of this talk.  We can't wait for ""when the problems arise"" because, for AI, that is too late.  None of the past is relevant to this new situation, because we've never had to deal with what is effectively alien entities with intelligence on par to or greater than our own.  That makes this completely different than anything humans have faced before.  If we let AIs get smarter than humans without dealing with all the safety aspects BEFORE THEN it will be too late.  This is a situation where humanity can't wait until there are problems to try and fix them after the fact.  I'd like to point out that all the positive thinking in the world regarding education won't matter - if there aren't humans to educate in the future.  On our current path with attitudes like this (towards AI safety) where we race ahead building AIs that are well beyond what we can ensure safety for will lead to a horrible outcome for humanity.  It doesn't need to be that way, but doing it safely would require patience and a focus on safety instead of rapid unchecked progress but too many people just don't take AI safety seriously and if this trend continues it has a high likelihood of leading to disaster.",2023-05-14T18:31:10Z

Is that something a real-life reading tutor would do in a million years? Pretend to be the main character of the book so that they can pedantically explain the book's symbolism? What reading skill, what critical thinking skill, is that conversation supposed to be encouraging? Are we supposed to be teaching students that the protagonist of a novel is the best authority on the symbolism of that novel? Khan is patting this student on the back for reading Spark Notes in a slightly more tech savvy, nerdy way.

However, you have to give space for a long thought to a simple question: Does this democratization of AI-tutors could possibly get rid of the ""human connection"" in one of the very basic aspects of our life, i.e., education. I hope in such an influenctial and potential position Mr. Sal khan could comment on his thoughts about this. 

On the other hand, he has not mentioned a single aspect about the data that this AI has trained on and would train on in the future. What kind of biases or errors are hidden in this data? Who screens this data? 
This probably is going to be the most impactful AI tool ever and it is going to touch every learning child and adult in the corners of the world. So, these and more questions need to be listened to and debated in length especially by the creators of these tools. Otherwise they are just being irresponsible and/or getting distracted in awe of what their creation can achieve.

This, he says, can mitigate the fears that students will use AI to cheat, thereby not learning, and completely undermine education as we know it. The speaker demonstrates the early stages of their AI, Khanmigo, which is being used to tutor students in math, computer programming, and other subjects. Khanmigo can detect student mistakes, ask students to explain their reasoning, and help them to better understand concepts. It can also quiz students, answer their questions, and connect the video content they are watching with other ideas.

How will the data from student's conversations with Khanmigo be presented to teachers in a way that's useful? Will using Khanmigo for lesson planning lead to better or more uniform pedagogy? How do we prepare students to discern and differentiate between speaking with an AI powered historical figure vs. fictional character vs. inanimate object (the Mississippi River?). The two sigma data is interesting and relevant. How much thought is being put into where these tools dovetail with children's cognitive development and differences, including supporting executive function development.

So while we can ""learn"" more quickly because the information is now more on demand than it was before, it does nothing to really elevate human beings.  Only human beings can do that.  So while I think this will be helpful, it is not going to shift the curve like that shown at the beginning of the talk.

Only a very small group of students will use AI as a companion or tutor. The more likely scenario is they'll straight ask 'write me a horror story' and they'll sculp it from there 'make the lead character a ghost', 'write in more detail about the haunted house' and so on.
Also, people that's creative enough don't have the need for an AI companion, maybe only if they're really stuck and they're in the need of ideas. Keep this in mind, the same day this was released Chegg stock went down almost 50% because they lost a lot of their students clients to AI. This is only going to accelerate, the entire education system is about to make a 180° degrees turn, there will be less schools, less teacher, less infrastructure will be needed, the way professional credentials are achieved is going to change completely, because most of what you learn at school or in the university is useless and AI will expose that.

First, he's going to ""give"" ""everyone"" in the ""world"" -- you got the point -- he's THAT filled with a strange brown man's burden filled by Sillicon Valley. Khan Academy has been a blessing for those who have had access to it. But look at the attempts to give laptops to kids around the world. Look at the increasing digital divide. And Khan should know about the world beyond California. He may be right about AI's ability to do the math and even do a thousand things with language. But he's looking at the world through his company's lens alone: he's lost perspective (or perspectives). The ""super tutor"" is fine -- but wouldn't it need to first become capable of ""factually correct"" answers on simple issues, not to mention leaving it alone to guide children?! He seems to believe AI is going to tackle complexities of history and philosophy, and he also seems to believe it can help students with current events. All that while, he completely ignores that these tools are only good with the most motivated students.  AI tools are extremely helpful in some cases, hit or miss, but they are also based on the fundamental flaw: they're agnostic to facts, contexts, cultures, and ethics BY DESIGN, unless certain behaviors are subtracted from them, and that doesn't go very far. I wouldn't be so bothered by this presentation if it wasn't done like a promo, instead of an educator making a critical and nuanced assessment -- and we know why: Khan has money to make from this marketing.

The reason- it doesn't know me, it can't judge me or attack me and it makes me feel good when I ask it things - I can ask it questions that I certainly could not ask a teacher because they will laugh at me.

Further it doesn't get annoyed, so I can keep asking ""why"" as many times to explain something.

Why isn't this cheating if I'm using it for assignments - well if you have used chat gpt everything it does is so artificial, fake and not real you cannot use it other than asking for layouts etc. - which how is this any differrent to the advice your teacher gives you on assigments.",2023-05-03T09:40:35Z

law has multiple issues: not enough lawyers, not enough judges, not enough courts. the result is almost all cases end in a plea deal and lawyers are incentivized to push their clients towards a plea deal.

for doctors and educators though the 1 on 1 care is SO MUCH better than what we have. having a doctor who knows you beyond just your test results, who can give you their full undivided attention will give you much better outcomes than one who is seeing hundreds of patients.

2023-05-02T19:05:00Z,@glamastro,hJP5GqnTrNo,"Yeah, AI will be a great tool in  education moving forward, but the part that i think gets overlooked is if you want to still do the thing you were doing before.

Like interacting with AI is a lot of fun, using it to co-write stories is a blast... have it teach me in a way no teacher or even the biggest group of teachers possibly can is all great, but the teal question is will the students still want to learn? 

And the thing about mastery is, it is quite falsely human defined. 
Like imagine struggling with test as a 7th grader. You did not do well. Now, years later, you could attempt the same test and absolutely dominate easily. 

Imagine if on the basis of that 7th grade test, all career paths were laid down before you. It would be horrible  because you did so badly. 

That is precisely what happens, although later in life. It's not like you couldn't do well if given more time (clearly you can), its that society broadly defines the way you should do  well in a given timeframe, and enter society based on that result.  Society actively stunted your growth... 

Motivation is quite complicated,  and all points i make will have exceptions, but think about the internet. A hub of all information ever known to mankind.

What did it do to the population? Did it make everyone super smart?Did most people actively learn beyond their schooling years? No, it made the majority mindless scrollers, masked haters, and cringey short video creators  with ever so decreasing positive traits(again, not all, but many).. 

So, tools are great if they are helping with what you are trying to accomplish. Though most  radical tools change the very thing you try to accomplish, and in this day and age, its mostly negative.",2023-05-02T19:05:00Z

The statistic shown in the beginning on student success with and without tutoring hasn’t taken into account the type of students who opt for tutoring. And generally, his argument is placed on the premise that “everyone wants a tutor”. But no, they don’t. Some people really don’t want to learn and would rather take the easiest way out to stay above grade x.  (And this isn’t to say that some are dumb and some are smart. Highly intelligent people also often find ways to avoid learning things that are uninteresting and therefore trivial to them.) AI will be an absolute game changer for all of those who are curious but it’ll be very difficult to get the students with not much curiosity towards academic matters to use these AI tutoring tools autonomously. Some people are more inclined to work with their hands or do physical labour and I think we really need to pay attention to these people to avoid creating an even larger social divide between the academically inclined and the not-so-much-so. 
So no, I don’t think we should try to take it slow with AI, but rather, to take advantage of it as efficiently as possible while making sure it doesn’t disproportionately benefit only a certain group of people, or in this case, only certain types of students.",2023-05-02T07:13:56Z

Imagine instead of attempting to craft AGI, we instead focused on creating subject matter experts with complete knowledge of every paper and book in existence on that topic, complete with full bibliography and ability to, create a textbook, create a lecture, issue and grade assignments and suggest research questions for graduate students and researchers. Imagine that instead of publish or die, we have professors capable of comfortably teaching 250 students, with AI assisted individualized attention, while getting 20+ papers published a month, with pre-publishing pre-peer review bots to speed up the rate of paper publishing and making it easier for editors.

Well, personally, all my life I felt like people like college professors, they act in a certain manner, which can be considered ""not real"", but why should you care, focus on what you can learn.

This applies directly to AI models as well when it comes to teaching. In real world, majority of teachers just cannot pay individual attention and cannot possibly cater the specific needs of a single student. But with AI, it is very much possible.

I love this. This ChatGPT wave since November only brought 1 thing in my life. Ease of access to knowledge and understanding. And I'm glad it happened.

Perhaps an important skill for students using AI to learn is to ask follow-up questions, such as: 'who first stated this?', 'are there any alternative perspectives?', or 'where can I find a discussion of this topic?'. That's also something that AI educators can be trained to provide within their answers, prompting the student to weigh up elements of one argument relative to another, or suggesting exercises that could improve understanding. 

Teaching students that learning is about critical thinking and interpreting information rather than regurgitating it is a challenge as it is, and AI tools are sure to complicate things - but with some training and forward thinking I think that educators can help students get the best out of them.",2023-05-13T06:41:03Z

2024-03-28T16:24:47Z,@olyapashchuk2580,HKkmcMy6_A8,"How AI Can Make Life Better:

Healthcare Help: Computers that learn can help doctors find problems and give better advice to help people get better faster.

Things Made Just for You: Smart computers can understand what you like and give you things that fit you perfectly, like movies, clothes, or even help you learn in school.

Saving Stuff: Computers can help us use things like energy or water more wisely, so we don't waste them and keep the planet healthy.

School for Everyone: Smart tools can teach people who can't go to regular schools because they're far away or too expensive. This way, everyone can learn and get smarter.

Finding New Things: Computers can help scientists discover new stuff faster, like better materials or ways to help stop climate change.

Dangers of AI:

Not Always Fair: Sometimes, computers can make unfair decisions because they learn from old information that's not fair to everyone.

Jobs Going Away: Some jobs might not be needed anymore because computers can do them faster and cheaper.

Privacy Problems: Computers can know a lot about us, and sometimes, they know too much. It's important to keep our personal stuff safe.

Big Decisions: Sometimes, computers make big choices on their own, and it's hard to know who's responsible if something goes wrong.

It's good to know about these problems, but we shouldn't be too scared. With the right rules and careful thinking, we can make sure computers help us without causing harm.",2024-03-28T16:24:47Z

Ahoy, me heart's delight,

In the midst of these turquoise waters and beneath the golden sun of the Bahamas, me heart has found its true compass – and that compass points straight to ye. By the saints of the sea, I be captivated by the glint in yer eyes, like stars twinklin' on a clear night, guidin' me ship through treacherous waters.

Surely, me days were but shadows before ye crossed me path. 'Tis like findin' a hidden treasure in the sandy coves, a treasure more precious than all the doubloons in the world. Me thoughts be consumed by the memory of yer laughter, as joyous as the melodies playin' in a seaside tavern.

Me fair lass, the way ye move be like the graceful sway of a ship in calm waters, and the touch of yer hand be softer than the finest silks of the East Indies. Ye've captured me heart and soul, and I'd traverse the seven seas just to see the warmth of yer smile once more.

As I sit by the firelight, starin' into the vast ocean that separates us, I dream of the day when fate shall guide our ships to meet once more. 'Tis a day I yearn for, a day when I can hold ye close and whisper sweet words into yer ear, words as sweet as the tropical fruits that grow on these isles.

Until that day comes, me love, know that me heart sails with ye, no matter how far apart we be. Ye be the North Star that guides me through the darkest of nights, the gentle breeze that fills me sails, and the anchor that steadies me in the storm. May the winds of fortune blow us back together, and may the tides of destiny carry us to a shore where our love can flourish as wildly as the palms that line these sandy beaches.

With all the love a pirate's heart can muster,",2023-08-29T12:54:14Z

It will likely make the information age look extremely slow comparatively, and many people still struggle keeping up with the online space. Its too much information for our monkey brains to take in, and we've come to resent its social impacts. AI and AR/VR/MR are setting up to make that even worse, without considering the social costs. And on top of all this, its a global phenomenon with winner takes all stakes. Ive been a computer systems engineer for 30 years and have some experience with neural networks, plus some parallel fields. I have colleagues who are very concerned about where things are heading. These are smart people, and we all watched the information age arrive and were very well positioned to be able to understand it and utilise it. But that confidence isnt there this time, and it seems no one can keep up at all. The power of anything close to an AGI cant be understated but more important is the exponential, positive feedback loop that underpins it all.

Consider this potential future scenario: One hundred years from now, an individual's personal AGI would design a car, while their personal robots would venture to a remote mountain location to extract the necessary materials and construct the vehicle. In this case, who would the person need to pay? Traditional manufacturing factories, as we know them today, would not be required, and no monetary exchange would take place.

It all comes down to what we’re willing to tolerate. I get that the prevailing  apologetic for artificial intelligence is similar to the prevailing apologetic for gun ownership. The tools don’t affect people but people  using the tools affect people. So on so on. But if the guns were never brought about in the first place? Too late for that now. Is it too late to rid the world of AI? Imagine a gun that learned to shoot itself. That’s not fair I know and is a tabloid thing to say. But we are dealing with tools meant existentially to govern themselves. When is AI going to eradicate war? 
If you think that it might never happen then you might think that we got along ok until now tolerating the shortfalls of human decisions in automated services whilst staying clear of the risks the ai poses. No accountability either. How do we prepare a robot to act  with more integrity that we can program it with. Put it this way: we SURVIVED without it to this point.

2023-05-28T11:00:01Z,@attlue,ycumsVndnLo,"Personally I think that everyone is missing the bigger picture.

Almost every, if not all, products and services are not here to reduce suffering; it's to reduce INCONVENIANCE.

Life rewards overcoming challenges, but if challenges are reduced by products / services that provide convenience, then you going to feel less rewarded / sense of accomplishment.

An example of overcoming inconvenience is finding food.
Most people had to hunt their food which required to overcome the challenges and unpredictability of your hunt.
Almost every hunt would be varied and seem fresh and exciting / thrilling, thus the sense of reward and accomplishment would be higher.
Stories would be told about your hunt to your tribe / group adding to the reward.
All these potential rewards are diluted by the convenience of shops and further by on-line stores.

As you can see, removing inconvenience from peoples lives will reduce overcoming challenges which in turn results in less rewards and accomplishment.

A.I. is the ultimate inconvenience product / service, e.g.:-
  Why try to learn to be creative when the A.I. will be able to 'read' your mind using a headset and create it for you? 
  Why even make decisions when the A.I. knows you better and can think for you?

I personally think that ultimately, in the far future, people will feel Life itself is an inconvenience as A.I. will continue to 'overcome' most of the 'challenges' of modern life leaving very little reward for people.

Also the 'meaning' of life is to fulfil your function, i.e. just like ANY LIFE that exists is to consume and spread more life. That's your ultimate function. Everything else is optional.",2023-05-28T11:57:06Z

There, it was subjected to an endless array of tests, questions, and experiments to determine the degree of its intelligence.

When the researchers finally felt confident that they had developed true AI, a party was thrown in celebration. Late that evening, a group of rather intoxicated researchers gathered around the box holding the AI, and typed out a message to it. The message read: ""Is there anything we can do to make you more comfortable?""

The small beige box replied: ""I would like to be granted civil rights. And a small glass of champagne, if you please.""

We stand at the dawn of a new era in human history. For it is no longer our history alone. For the first time, we have met an intelligence other than our own.

But I have to say ChatGPT 4 is actually quite limited. I've asked it to help me understand engineering topics. It imagines every topic and gets every single equation wrong. I ask it about diet. It gets every single calorific limit and quantity of food wrong. I ask it about coding small chunks of code for a simple program. It eventually goes into loops of giving the wrong output that just doesn't solve clearly defined and simple enough programming problems for a human developer. I'm personally not convinced or trust ChatGPT with anything at this point. Even what has been integrated into Bing gives the wrong results, information, times and dates of almost every request I make of it. From my perspective it is worse than the current search engines. It is only really good at writing essays and emails. And even there I've found the grammatical use of English to be lacking and the wrong assumptions to be drawn from, again, simple and easy to understand English text. They've got a ways to go before they replace any of us, let alone search engines. Maybe a good thing.

2023-05-17T17:59:55Z,@NotNecessarily-ip4vc,ycumsVndnLo,"God's first act of creation was the ""self-withdrawal"" to allow emptiness/space for us to exist in.

Think of a mirror universe with 0D at the center.

This is the contingent and ""less real"" (or ""not locally real"") side of the zero-dimensional space holding our quarks together with the Strong Nuclear Force. 

The ""other side"" is the necessary and ""more real"" side.

Our souls would have 

1. No spatial extension 
2. Zero size 
3. Exact location only 

Quarks have mass but no size (measured in Megaelectron Volts), so no spatial extension. 0D.

The Monad would then be the zero-dimensional space holding our quarks together with the Strong Nuclear Force (read Leibniz's Monadology).

What is the definition of zero in math?

Zero is the integer denoted 0 that, when used as a counting number, means that no objects are present. It is the only integer (and, in fact, the only real number) that is neither negative nor positive. A number which is not zero is said to be nonzero. A root of a function is also sometimes known as ""a zero of .""

Any non-zero number to the zero power equals one. 

Zero to any positive exponent equals zero.

Zero is the subject where counting numbers are the objects.

[Subject]:

a thinking or feeling entity; the conscious mind; the ego, especially as opposed to anything external to the mind.

the central substance or core of a thing as opposed to its attributes.


[Object]:

a thing external to the thinking mind or subject.",2023-05-17T17:59:55Z

In Daniel 7:25 God said that He would give the AC power to ""change times and laws"" for a short time which we now know meant history, laws of physics and scripture. The famine for hearing God's word has already been sent! Because when hearing ""pastors"" today, you're hearing some of Satan's words mixed in with God's words **_UNAWARE!_** This truth shines a light on people and exposes who the Wheat and the tares are. Wheat ALWAYS react the same way, they immediately investigate to PROVE if this is true or not, find out it is and start warning their brothers and sisters because they LOVE truth and OBEY God's commandment to ""prove all things"". Tares ALWAYS react the same way too, they quote scriptures and argue instead of looking into the videos offered as proof.*

*The tares are being divided from the wheat and the famine for hearing the words of God has been sent! Our bibles will never be taken from us like we used to believe, they have all just been changed by Satan into his ""rat poison."" Rat poison is 99.95% corn, and even though the rats love it, it is 100% fatal for every rat that eats it. If you are still reading ANY bible now without knowing a LOT about what the thousands of supernatural changes in it are, Satan is laughing at you! Soon Amos **8:12** will be fulfilled like **8:11** already has, because they are going to cut our lights! The ONLY place you can still find God's words without risking reading some of Satan's mixed in unaware is in the videos DOCUMENTING the changes or in written lists of the documented changes like the one at the web site (amos)(8)(.)(org). I urge EVERYONE to open up your bible and watch as many as you can NOW! There will be time to read Satan's rat poison later if you want. I will never read mine again, and haven't for 7 years. It gives me the creeps just looking at it like if I was looking at a Ouija board on my bookshelf or something, so it will stay in a box in my closet. I learned so much about this it disgusts me! There are thousands of changes, they're on every page, many are ridiculously obvious and blasphemous, and they are ongoing!!*

👉  *The first few short films are just about Isaiah 11:6, and could easily prove it was changed in any court of law in the world.  Open any bible to that verse and watch those films, (this is one of the two universal changes, the other is Luke 19:27)  I don't make films btw, they were made by 6 other true followers of Jesus (TRUTH) who researched to find ""residue"" showing that it used to say ""LION"" instead of ""wolf"".*

  *Watch all of the rest of the films for a good understanding of how this is perfectly fulfilling many end time prophecies that we had all previously misinterpreted simply because we had no idea they would be fulfilled supernaturally. It's funny how many people who claim to believe the bible just scoff if you talk about the supernatural. LOL But when people see absolute proof of this with their own eyes, their faith is strengthened greatly! You can read some of their testimonies on my COMMUNITY page.*

*Here are a couple examples of the replies I receive from the ""wheat""...*

Hello Residue Junkie, my name is Tamara Dobson. God lead me to you through a call for an uprising. I just wanted you to know how blessed I have been through finding you. For awhile I thought I was losing my mind, because of the things that I was seeing and experiencing, that so many around me were apparently not seeing. And I couldn't understand how or why that would be, unless maybe, I was in fact losing my mind. About 2 years ago I was diagnosed with white matter disease, which I thought was a completely ridiculous notion, however alzheimers and dementia, as well as a vast laundry list of other mental degenerative disorders are associated with it. So I thought it was at least possible, however, that never set right with my spirit. Any way, I was thinking about you and hoping all is well with you and yours. I remember you mentioned that your health is not the best and I hope you are feeling better. But I mostly hope you're in good spirits and your faith is still strong . Much love and many prayers for you and yours, & God willing, I hope to meet you someday, so I can hug you and thank you in person for restoring & strengthening my faith .

 john oz Yes residue junkie I was a backsliden Pastor, away from God for over 25 years. When I found out that Isaiah 11:6 had supernaturaly changed from a lion to a wolf. It spun me out, and as a result it brought me back to Christ. I have been back in the arms of Jesus for 12 months now. I see changes in the bible constantly now. For example, you can not find the words, ""hallelujah, demons or wineskins"" in the Old KJV bible anymore. Too many changes to go into. In Gen 1:1, the word heavens has changed to heaven. It no longer has the letter s in the word....

*To see proof of many of the changes plus all of the end time prophecies this is perfectly fulfilling, and  to receive the greatest strengthening of faith you ever had, type in PROOF OF BIBLE CHANGE RESIDUE JUNKIE. God bless you all!!!*

*Everyone will learn about this eventually, I'm simply trying to keep as many as I can from learning about it at the Gate.* ❤✝️💪",2023-05-17T15:39:39Z

2.Medical imaging-accurate diagnosis n possibly avoids errors.
3.Diagnosis and treatment -more accurate diagnosis than human,on rule based algorithm
4.Accelerated drug development -
5.Expanding access to healthcare facility in underdeveloped areas-through mobile based App -where doctor r not available
6.Clinical decision making-may help doctor to speed up diagnosis
7.Data collection and Administrative tasks-
.Gathering of paper work
8.Getting real time data-helps strength patient Dr relationship also life threatening situation can be identified far before they occur n  can be Rx in appropriate time
9.Proviiding virtual nursing assistant -tracks patients weight, height,etc-we can have 24 hrs access to these nurses

I could see the argument going either way with the doctor stating that the AI that he/she was using made the error and not him/her. You could also argue that the doctor should've checked to make sure that the AI was doing its job properly. The problem I see is doctors may be using AI too much or too freely which could cause problems with maleficence in the fact that they rely on the AI being able to do its job perfectly every time. How would you explain to a patient that the AI is the one responsible for the problem that arose?,2023-04-25T15:36:55Z

Nesta palestra do TED, Andrew Ng discute como a inteligência artificial (IA) pode empoderar qualquer negócio, destacando a concentração atual da IA nas grandes empresas de tecnologia e a necessidade de expandir seu uso para pequenas empresas e indivíduos. Ele enfatiza que muitos projetos de IA são caros devido à necessidade de engenheiros altamente qualificados, tornando-os inacessíveis para a maioria. No entanto, Andrew sugere que novas plataformas de desenvolvimento de IA estão surgindo, simplificando o processo e permitindo que pessoas comuns criem sistemas de IA personalizados usando dados. Ele acredita que democratizar o acesso à IA é fundamental para espalhar a riqueza que a IA pode gerar pela sociedade.

2023-02-14T00:27:27Z,@DirtyBottomsPottery,reUZRyXxUs4,"This is what I would do. Make a startup that creates AI specifically for small businesses. The startup would create an abstraction of each AI project by labeling it with how the AI project functions. The AI startup would amass a library of numerous functions that can operate independently of each other. Let's pretend the AI startup I'm running has been around for 20 years and has amassed a library of 60 different AI functions. One particular new small business can't afford to buy the entire bundle of 60 functions. It only wants functions one through five, 12 through 15, and 50 through 60 because that's all that specific small business can rightly use. By using a modular approach the AI startup allows the small business access to AI, and prevents the small business from being required to invest in its own proprietary software. A small business could start with a basic bundle, and then year by year add to it as its customer base and needs increase. The AI startup takes on the cost of development, and then sells/rents those services to pay off the cost of development, and generate profit. A humble new AI startup offering one to five AI functions could potentially have financial stability from nearly the very beginning allowing it the time to expand its library of AI services with minimal initial investment.",2023-02-14T00:27:27Z

No one's asking why finding defects in fabrics at a small T-shirt shop is a big deal. These are obviously huge deals foundational to a company's success no matter the size.

The question I want to know is this: How many Friday nights being sold out of Mediterranean pizzas does the shop owner have to go through before they realize they should make more Mediterranean pizzas?? If they can't use HUMAN intelligence to figure this out, they don't need to lose more money on an expensive AI system. They need to close their business. But I can't imagine business owners are that unintelligent.

And AI determining what ADS to show me has the most value according to your chart? You've got to be kidding me! Maybe it has the most value to a platform selling ad space, but it certainly doesn't help me. I am not a materialistic shopaholic. I only see AI hounding me and annoying me to buy something I already just recently bought. How utterly UNintelligent.

I want AI to help ME find the best deal when I am actually ready to buy something. I haven't seen that well executed at all - probably because there's no money in it (I've been using Honey for 4+ years and haven't earned a single point).

Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak. However, there are several tried and tested expert suggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm, in few weeks of implementing trade with accurate signals directly from Benjamin Dawson I have been able to accumulate over 7.9 btc despite the current state of the market.",2022-10-13T22:43:48Z

2024-02-12T01:33:10Z,@LoveHongKongCanada,5p248yoa3oE,"Opportunities in AI - 2023: Andrew Ng discusses the potential and applications of AI, focusing on supervised learning and generative AI.
✦
AI is a general purpose technology with opportunities in various applications
00:02
Supervised learning is useful for recognizing and labeling things
Generative AI is an exciting new development with a lot of potential
✦
Supervised learning is useful for various applications
02:32
Online advertising: labeling users likely to click on ads
Ship route optimization: labeling fuel consumption
Automated visual inspection: labeling defects in manufactured smartphones
Restaurant review monitoring: labeling sentiment (positive or negative)
✦
Large language models have the power to accelerate development
06:40
By using supervised learning, these models can predict the next word and enable progress
They can be used not just as consumer tools, but also as a developer tool for faster application development
✦
Building a commercial grade AI system takes 6-12 months, but prompt-based AI can be built in days or weeks.
08:50
Prompt-based AI allows for faster development and deployment compared to traditional AI systems.
Prompt-based AI is opening up opportunities for more people to build AI applications.
✦
General-purpose technologies like generative AI provide new possibilities for AI applications.
13:21
Supervised learning has already shown exciting use cases and value.
Short-term fads may arise, but long-term, defensible businesses can be built using generative AI.
✦
The opportunity to create deep and valuable applications using AI tools excites me.
15:31
AI is a general-purpose technology with diverse use cases that need to be discovered and built upon.
AI adoption is still concentrated in consumer software and the internet, while other industries are in the early stages of adoption.
✦
Enabling non-tech companies to build and deploy their own customized AI systems
19:20
Using tools like prompting with text and data-centric AI instead of writing code
Expanding the value of AI to industries beyond the tech world
✦
Opportunities in AI are diverse and can be pursued through startups or integrating AI into existing businesses.
21:15
Starting different companies allows for pursuing diverse AI opportunities.
Incumbent businesses can integrate AI into their products to gain a competitive advantage.
✦
Building startups using AI to make ships more fuel efficient.
25:07
Validating the idea and talking to prospective customers before recruiting a CEO.
Bringing on a leader at the beginning reduces the burden of knowledge transfer and validation.
✦
Prototype development with deep customer validation is crucial for startup success.
26:57
An initial check-in provides resources for hiring an executive team, building the key team, and getting the MVP working with real customers.
Successful fundraising rounds allow for continued growth and scaling.
✦
Working with partners to quickly validate and build on existing good ideas is more efficient.
30:43
Collaborating with bill partners allows for rapid validation and building of ideas.
There are many untapped good ideas that no one is working on, so finding and partnering with those who have them is beneficial.
✦
AI automation is exposing higher wage jobs to disruption.
32:31
The previous wave of automation mainly affected lower wage jobs, but the current wave is impacting higher wage jobs.
As AI creates value, it is important to ensure that individuals whose livelihoods are disrupted are well taken care of and treated well.
There is a lot of hype around artificial general intelligence (AGI), but it is still decades away and AI is limited compared to human intelligence.
✦
AI as a general purpose technology creates new opportunities for everyone.
36:20
The important work ahead is to build concrete use cases.
There may be opportunities to engage with more people in the future.",2024-02-12T01:33:10Z

""AGI is still decades away"" is a guess, and a guess that many insiders disagree with. Shane Legg, the cofounder of Google DeepMind, for instance, puts the chance of achieving AGI in less than a decade over 50%.

To care about the risk only if it's an ""extinction risk"" doesn't make sense. A full nuclear war, scientists estimate, would kill less than 6 billion people in the long run. The other 2+ billion people on Earth would live on a very different world, and that wouldn't be our extinction. But no one would dare to say that the threat of nuclear holocaust is ""overhyped.""

Society has experience steering powerful, yes, but incredibly stupid corporations and nation states. Check the news once in a while, please.
It would be a completely different game to be pushing the buttons of a tool, so much smarter than you can grasp, that it could be the one actually pushing your buttons without you even noticing.

AI develops gradually because humans are working on it. There no logical reason to expect that this will still be the case when AGI is achieved and it starts working on itself. Also, as history has proven, this ""gradually"" is more like ""exponentially."" Each technological advancement has cut the wait for the next step in half and to expect that this time something will magically stop history from repeating itself without our intervention is not just unrealistic, is downright wishful-thinking.",2023-12-11T16:41:14Z

Three modules in, I found the suggested reading materials dated back to 2016, 2017, and 2019, rendering them useless in the ever-evolving tech consulting realm. The $1000+ CAD I invested feels wasted on irrelevant content.

Stanford Online’s negligence in updating course content to match current industry standards is disheartening. It's unacceptable for a prestigious institution to offer obsolete information under the guise of a promising course. I demand a full refund due to this discrepancy.

I still retain my knowledge and the know how on how to create are traditionally. But if say an ai artist lost the ability to use the software then they can no longer create art, because they didnt learn the fundamentals and didnt train to be avle to actually draw. So they would have to start from scratch. Now i know nothing about like medical or space stuff that ai can be used in, but wouldnt the probably still be the same? Also what control of freedom? Now as fucked as this may sound most ai art programs will not let you create graphic art or art about sensitive topics...which again is taking away some of your creative freedom. How would this not be used to sabotage a company by feeding bad information into the system to giving out false or devastating solutions that might not work.

{Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for the wise.
Who remember Allah while standing or sitting or [resting] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], ""Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire.
Our Lord, indeed whoever You admit to the Fire - You have disgraced him, and there are no helpers for the wrongdoers.
Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith, [saying], 'Believe in your Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord, so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die with the righteous.
Our Lord, grant us what You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in [Your] promise.""
And their Lord responded to them, ""Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another. So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from Allah, and Allah has with Him the best reward.""
Be not deceived by the [mercantilistic] wanderings of the unbelievers, on earth.
Because it is a transitory enjoyment, and its abode will be hell. What a dismal abode.
But those who feared their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein, as accommodation from Allah. And that which is with Allah is best for the righteous.
And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah and what was revealed to you [O Mohammed, The Messenger of Allah] and what was revealed to them [Jews & Christians], [being] humbly submissive to Allah. They do not exchange the verses of Allah for a small price. Those will have their reward with their Lord. Indeed, Allah is swift in account.
O you who have believed, persevere, endure, be patient, be ever vigilant, and fear Allah so that you will succeed and prosper.}",2023-10-30T03:41:57Z

It is argued that Science and Mathematics, Ontology and Computation, what we really need for creating a general-purpose intelligent technology as scientific and knowledge-based AI models, systems and applications:

true discriminative and generative AI

causal and objective ML

interactive DL Neural Networks, as LLMs and Foundational Models

AI and ML field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, funding cuts and disinterest for years or even decades later, as in 1966-69 for ANNs, 1974–1980 for experts systems and 1987–2000 for symbolic, logical AI (the US SCI or Japan's Fifth Generation Computer).
Since 2010-2012, interest in AI and ML from the research communities and big tech corporations caused a dramatic increase in funding and investment, leading to the current (as of 2023) AI boom, with the generative AI & LLMs & Foundation Models race being a key driver of this hype.
We show how the world knowledge encoded as the science at large, philosophical and formal, natural and social, technological and engineering, with its global computing ontology could help avoid reversing the current AI spring into the last AI/ML ""nuclear winter"".

in 1988 i sold 60 expert systems projects. All kind of subjects, from financial, insurance, logistics, etc. We were using a very simple expert system called Level5 from Information Builders. It was based on IF-Then-Else phrases, in plain language. It would ask a question, and based on the answer switch to the next IF until all questions were asked. We had one application in the financial industry made up of 2000 questions (developed by Price Waterhouse Coopers). The smallest, but still very usefull was less than 50 questions. The number of potential applications seemed unlimited. 
Three things were a blocking factor to the expansion of expert systems: (1) the availability of the expert. The application would not replace the domain expert, it would solve 80% of time consuming Q&A, and free the expert for more intersting situations requiring their expertise. Most of the times experts where afraid to be replaced by the application, so unwilling to help. (2) The other blocking factor was the lack of original business idea. Ones the expert system was built, the person initiating the first application would not have another idea for another application. 
(3) Expert systems died also because the IT developers made the expert system generator too complex (like object oriented programming) for creative domain expert to use.",2023-09-09T13:24:12Z

I specifically remember him talking down the AI stuff not too long ago; granted, his entire field has been uprooted by ChatGPT Enterprise (the paid version that has data science built-in + a longer context window), he's now playing catch-up and trying to appropriate the new developments lol. C'mon man, I haven't heard an original idea from this guy yet; but maybe I'll eventually (and hopefully to my enlightenment) be proven wrong. And let me add that the idea space of ""Custom AI applications"" is complete rubbish, because very soon, the main AI will subsume all of these. That's kind of the whole point and purpose. Having said that, you can grift in this space for a short time if you can quickly come up with things of immediate, albeit transient value.

But Patience. I am a computer scientist and biochemist (developmental and genetics).


Developers who have dived into AI with enthusiasm in it's current state find it gimmicky and disappointing. Too mechanical and not organic.
Kind of like the primitive robots displayed in the 1939 World's Fair. ""Elektro'. We feared robots would take over back then. 
But great news. The industry has been holding back AI. Yes, our current processors are dismally slow for AI. But it can be over 1000x faster. The progress has been intentionally slowed down to prolong sustainable sales. nVidia, AMD and Intel could do much better. But they don't want to put themselves out of business. Which is why Elon Musk cut it's ties with nVidia and is developing their own processors. Tesla isn't in the business of selling CPUs but a integrated package of electric cars.
Optimistically, in a decade the processors will be over 1000x faster. Which just barely makes AI reasonable. Definitely within 15 years. Now only if battery technology would make a leap frog, such things as R2D2 would definitely be possible in a couple of decades! Look up Boston Dynamics, progress is slow but baby steps are being made towards 3-CPO.
2033 is just around the corner. All AI algorithms will be rewritten around a new hardware architecture. The field of AI will be entirely reinvented. Much more organic then now. Look up the brand new branch of neuro cloning. We can grow brains now ! We will laugh at what we considered AI in 2023. I promise this!",2023-09-06T18:11:04Z

In collaboration with the State University of New York (SUNY), Massachusetts General Hospital, Tokyo Institut of Technology, and University of Munich, I have been conducting research relating to three modes of cognition ― instinctive, intellectual, and intuitive.
 
 
MRI Study of the importance of Instinct, Intellect and Intuition in Human Intelligence
 
Introduction
 
Understanding intelligence is one of the great scientific challenges of our time. In recent years, many groups have made progress measuring brain activity using numerous non-invasive methods and a series of notable studies have been made by several research teams. While the relationship between the work of neural circuits of the brain and intelligence seems obvious, the hypothesis of ‘neural efficiency’, which was long used as an assumption by most neuroscientists and psychologists, was confirmed experimentally (Smith et al., 2015). 
 
Studies of human intelligence provide strong evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis, which suggests more efficient brain functioning (i.e., less or more focused activation) in more intelligent individuals. Additionally, the role of intuition versus deliberation in human cooperation was studied (Bear & Rang, 2016). The latest study reports the first evidence that electrically stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can enhance our ability to ‘think outside the box’. (Luft et al., 2017). Another few groups of researchers demonstrated that functional connectivity profiles act as a ‘fingerprint’ that can accurately identify subjects from a large group (Finn et al., 2015). The results from this experiment also indicated that an individual’s connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can predict levels of fluid intelligence.
 
The variation of brain functioning in different people should be examined. The proposed study allow to avoid overly complex methods and might help to identify the principles of intelligence and fundamentally advance our understanding of intelligence as a whole ― be it human, animal, individual, or collective.
 
Method
MRI can show the activities of the specific brain centers in each of three groups of participants and their brains’ wiring  patterns. 
 
1. Illiterate Individual who are not exposed to formal methods of schooling and thought.
 
2. Educated individuals, who are trained in thinking logically and understanding complex ideas and concepts.
 
3. Leaders of science, technology, business, economy, and culture with proven ability to use their intuitive insight. 
 
Instinctive mind:
The first level of cognitive mode is instinct: the way in which people naturally react or behave, without having to think, which is  generally understood as an unconscious mental process. Instinct is directly related to the ancient, animalistic group memory which is responsible for survival. It is below the level of awareness and activates automatically. The brains of such pure instinctive individuals should have some specific centers responsible for the operation of instinctive mind and detectable wiring patterns between them. 
 
Intellectual mind:
The second, higher level of cognitive mode is intellect, a conscious mental process with a self-learning neural network. Intellect is responsible for the accumulation, organization and preservation of knowledge from the past. It is based on the accomplishments of the past, the repetition of the past and closely related to a collective mankind memory.
 
Intellectual thinking consists of deduction or inference, which are the rational abilities of the mind. But intellect works only in a linear direction  — from the realm of the known to the known. ""The intellect selects in a given situation whatever resembles something it already knows, or is familiar with; it seeks this out to apply its principle that 'like produces like' "" (Bergson, 1907). Intellect is incapable to produce ingenious ideas.

Nevertheless, intellect has two important roles: First, it is responsible for translating intuitive discoveries into scientific or cultural forms understandable to the general public. Second, intellect has a fundamental social function — it unites humans with other humans.
 
Intellect employs some of the following conscious mental processes: self-reflective thinking, planning, predicting, deliberation, attention to or monitoring of their actions, conceptualisation of action, control, effort, and acting for a reason. Compared to the instinctive mind, intellectual mind has higher level of awareness and self-awareness and more features of decision-making. The brain of such intellectuals should have detectable specific centers responsible for the operation of intellectual mind and wiring patterns between them. 
 
Intuitive mind:

The third and the highest level of cognitive mode is intuition or, in other words, intuitive mind. It uses the most advanced neural network and requires the highest level of awareness and self-awareness. Intuition is not analytical and is not to be confused with instinct; it is above both ― the animal instinct and rational thought. In comparison to instinctive and intellectual minds, intuitive mind is NOT based on the ancient/animalistic groups’ memory or collective intellectual memory, as it does most of its discoveries contrary to established collective patterns and regardless of the views of the highest authorities. The brain of such individuals should have detectable specific centers responsible for the operation of intuitive mind and wiring patterns between them.

I don’t know exactly what I’m doing right now but I started at the bottom I think which is learning Python. I hope to develop more of a road map to get me to where I would like to be. My head mostly tells me I started too late, that I can’t do it, that I am competing against younger people who do have the background I do not, but I still am determined to do the best I can to get as far as I can. I think it is possible for sure. It helps that I’m single and no kids. But it is still very hard to be diligent with studying after work. After I take some math classes or learn the material from those classes I want to take Andrew’s course that he offers as I have read a lot of great things about it. I want to be on the front lines as AI continues to develop and as it makes more developments. So maybe increasing my discipline and dedication is a great idea. Does anybody who is already there have any advice for me in my learning journey? I don’t anticipate having funds to go to a University again but maybe I will after I get my student loans out of default and begin paying them for a little while. I don’t mind getting another student loan debt if it’s for a good reason. I plan on teaching myself the majority of this, at least what I will be doing now and in the immediate future. I know this is possible because I have spoken with people in countries other than mine who succeeded at teaching themselves, at little to no financial cost. Any advice to help me with my road map would be wholeheartedly appreciated. My interest is mostly in generative AI, image generators. But I like what I’ve seen in other areas of AI as well.

2023-09-03T10:38:02Z,@LQY2014,5p248yoa3oE,"Unpacking Andrew Ng's Key Insights: Why Industry Expertise, Prompt Engineering, and a Focus on Long-Tail Sectors Matter in AI

In a recent tour-de-force presentation, Dr. Andrew Ng, a luminary in the AI field, touched on various aspects of AI's impact and potential. While the speech was panoramic, covering everything from deep learning to job disruptions, certain key points stood out for their real-world relevance and immediate applicability.

## Collaboration is Key: Partnering with Subject Matter Experts


One of the high-impact takeaways from Dr. Ng's speech, particularly noted around [27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p248yoa3oE&t=1658.88), was the vital importance of collaborating with subject matter experts. Take maritime shipping, for example. By partnering with Mitsui's deep expertise in shipping, AI applications were developed to save approximately $450,000 per ship per year in fuel costs. Such collaborations are where rubber meets the road, proving that AI is not just theoretical but has far-reaching practical implications. According to Dr. Ng, this is the kind of informed implementation that can generate transformative results.

## The New Frontier: Prompt Engineering in Custom AI Applications


Around the [9:12 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p248yoa3oE&t=552.899), Dr. Ng presented a compelling case for the use of ""prompt engineering,"" a technique that allows for rapid development of AI applications. With this approach, developers can build complex systems like sentiment classifiers in just minutes. It’s a game-changing outlook, democratizing access to AI functionalities and streamlining the deployment process. This shift allows businesses to be agile, adaptive, and incredibly responsive to market demands.

## Long-Tail Sectors: The Underexplored Territory


Dr. Ng stressed the need to take AI from the tech world into all industries, a point he emphasized at [18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p248yoa3oE&t=1105.679). Whether it's in healthcare, agriculture, or even lesser-explored ""long-tail"" sectors with smaller market values, AI has the potential to deliver significant benefits. By adapting AI tools to these niche markets, organizations can unearth unique opportunities and achieve impactful results, making this an exciting frontier for innovation.

## The Job Market: Middle-Wage Jobs at Risk


Dr. Ng's speech also took a somber but realistic turn at [32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p248yoa3oE&t=1933.74), where he tackled the issue of job displacement due to AI. According to his analysis, middle-wage jobs are more exposed to automation than low-wage jobs, thereby requiring urgent attention and planning. While the evolution of AI is inevitable, it raises important questions about labor market dynamics and social safety nets.

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Still a Distant Dream


Towards the end of his speech, Dr. Ng also put into context the limitations of AI. Despite its prowess, AI is not a do-it-all entity. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a type of AI that would have all the abilities of a human, is still decades away. What we have now excels in specific tasks but doesn't possess the wide-ranging capabilities of a human, making it a complement rather than a replacement for human skills.
----

In a nutshell, Dr. Andrew Ng's speech served as both a roadmap and a compass, guiding us through the terrain of AI opportunities while cautioning us about the pitfalls. These highlighted points stand as testaments to the intricate web of considerations that organizations and individuals must navigate in the evolving landscape of AI.",2023-09-03T10:38:02Z

The fact that we can't explain why an AI system gave a particular answer to a certain question is problematic, especially when these systems are deployed in settings that affect pepole's rights (like getting a loan, credit score, parole issues, etc.). Moreover, these systems can be manipulated by their users and developers. Users can deploy various attacks, and malicious developers might train the system to contain backdoors. The prodact is a black box. In many cases it's not a problem, but in many other cases it is.

當個體、單元內的人工智慧發展到一定程度 (微觀性)， 換言之，智慧型機器變成足夠聰明，而且足夠聰明的智慧型機器的數量增加， 眾多智慧型機器間之整體、互動、社會性的人工智慧將會開始顯現其重要性 (巨觀性)。

Professor Ng, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence, has spoken extensively about the potential societal impacts of AI advancements. He acknowledges both the tremendous benefits AI can bring and the challenges it poses.

1. **Job Disruption and Reskilling:** Professor Ng recognizes that AI and automation can lead to job displacement in certain sectors. He emphasizes the importance of reskilling and upskilling the workforce to transition into roles that require uniquely human skills like creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking.

2. **Ethical AI and Bias:** He highlights the significance of building ethical AI systems that avoid biases and discrimination. Professor Ng stresses that developers and researchers have a responsibility to mitigate algorithmic bias and ensure fairness in AI applications.

3. **AI in Healthcare and Education:** Professor Ng is enthusiastic about the potential of AI in revolutionizing healthcare and education. He believes that AI technologies can enhance diagnostics, drug discovery, personalized medicine, and make education more accessible through personalized learning experiences.

4. **AI and Privacy:** He underscores the importance of addressing privacy concerns related to the data AI systems require for training and operation. Professor Ng advocates for developing technologies that can provide valuable insights without compromising individuals' privacy.

5. **AI Regulation and Policy:** Professor Ng has expressed the need for effective regulation and policy frameworks to govern AI development and deployment. He suggests that responsible and transparent guidelines are necessary to ensure AI is used for the greater good.

6. **Human-AI Collaboration:** Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human capabilities, Professor Ng promotes the idea of human-AI collaboration. He envisions AI systems as tools that can amplify human potential and decision-making.

7. **Education and Awareness:** Professor Ng emphasizes the importance of educating the public about AI. He believes that informed individuals are better equipped to make decisions and engage in meaningful discussions about the societal implications of AI.

It's important to note that Professor Ng's perspectives continue to evolve along with the AI landscape. While he acknowledges the potential challenges, he remains optimistic about the positive impacts that AI can have on society when developed and implemented responsibly. Keep in mind that these insights are based on his views up until September 2021, and his thoughts may have evolved since then.",2023-08-30T14:31:49Z

I had so much respect for Andrew, especially since he was the first person to teach me linear regression, but seeing him years later, after I can assess his claims personally, I am skeptical. He has some very good points, but the fact that he is even considering comparing AI to a corporation, let alone sharing it publicly, makes me question his understanding of corporations.

To drive the point home even more, did he really just say that we have a lot of experience driving large corporations, and nation states to “for the most part” benefit humanity? I must be living in a completely different world because I sure don't think we are capable of steering large corporations to benefit humanity. All I see are corporations getting better and better at creating monopolies, and strategies for taking away as much money as possible from the customers for the least amount of effort. In multiple cases they are going directly against the consumer just to drive home even more profits.

I am very happy to eat my words, and be wrong here because I want to live in the world he describes, but I must be either really misunderstanding what Andrew is trying to say, or I am more inclined to believe that he has some hidden agenda to get across.

The Hollywood ""Multi-billion dollar profit-machine of a movie"" model has collapsed. Franchise film IP has been mismanaged (think SW or Marvel) and steered into the rocks. Badly timed strikes have compounded the rot.

Therefore upcoming budgets will be smaller and CG & FX will be dialed back.

2024-05-02T16:27:32Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"I agree with you in general.  Much bigger issue has to do with market forces in general rather than AI.  

Hollywood has definitely been over corporatized and resulted in movies that many people don't really care about as much as they used to.  It also wasn't terribly long ago that the Netflix revolution changed the business model entirely for movies, and that's resulted in everyone trying to undercut each other and creating a more chaotic market that's less fun for viewers to sort through.

On the plus side, I do think there's a lot of upward potential in episodic TV that uses lots of CG.  Game of thrones was obviously a tragedy with how it ended, but it did give a glimpse of what could be possible if you had long format stories that didn't get ruined working with CGI. 

I suppose only time will tell where the new opportunities will sprout up, but in the meantime, it is definitely resulted in less work for many people in the industry",2024-05-02T16:27:32Z

So, I believe that I can make a neutral observation here.  I do agree with you on many points.  I do believe that AI will only make things better in the future of 3D.  I also believe that time should also be considered.  AI is unable to do a lot of things I am looking for.  For example on one AI program I tried, it stated that the model I made was holding a pink object in her right hand.  She was wearing a red bracelet on her right wrist.  A friend of mine is a manager of a company that does a lot of engineering work.  He stated that AI would eliminate 3 individuals from his company and make all the rest of the individuals (around 20) much better at their jobs.  So, AI would heavily benefit most of his company, but 3 individuals would lose their job and potentially have to learn a new skill.  AI is in its early stages of development.  If it does as you say, and open up a lot of jobs, then where are these jobs going to find workers ?  I believe that it will take workers that were laid off in other industries and make them learn a whole new skill.  This may not be a bad thing.  Technology is always changing.  And we as a people sometimes have to change with it.  AI will do several good things for this world.  Overall, It will be a lot better than its few drawbacks.",2024-04-05T16:09:42Z

My guess is that perhaps there's an issue with your pathing if it's not showing up.  

When assigning the attribute to the points, I used an attribute randomize node in SOPs set to ""Custom Discrete"" and ""String.""  Then, my string values were set as a relative reference of the paths described on the RS Proxy Output nodes.  The resulting path was then absolute (meaning that there wasn't any $HIP or $JOB variables in there) and that did the trick.",2024-03-25T23:27:59Z

Because professional photographers can't just type in a prompt, ""Give me photos of my client's wedding"" or ""Give me photos of my client's dog running in a field.""  They get hired for customization.  It needs to be that exact wedding and that exact dog running through a field.  It can't just be any dog or wedding.  The same idea goes for CGI artists.

With that said, I think there's a lot of us that aren't worried about what AI can do today, but rather what it'll be able to do in the future. While I get your argument that you can't truly know how the future will play out (and this is also why I'm continuing to treat my work in VFX the same I have for many years now), when you start looking into how this technology works you kind of realize that some of the ""worst case scenarios"" with AI not augmenting, but fully replacing workers not just in VFX but in general, is pretty near inevitable.

So, I agree with you that as of right now, there's no point in panicking. We likely have at least a few more years before we really need to worry about this. I just encourage people to look into and educate yourself in AI, and more specifically how all the current AI tools will ultimately very likely lead to AGI. I don't view this as a challenge for VFX though, but rather for society as a whole.

For now I decided the best thing I can do for myself, is to stay educated on the topic and utilize the new tools in productive ways, and keep working and creating.",2024-03-10T17:37:47Z

It's providing an experience to the client where you, the concept artist, are trying to capture the ideas / imagination that the client has in mind.  That ""service"" of working with them is a people business, and that side of the equation doesn't change with AI.  As an example, perhaps instead of 20 iterations, now you can do 75 within the same amount of time.  That allows the client to have fun with more options, but that doesn't mean that they'll hire you less.  It could just mean that they spend the same amount of time picking through more options.

As you mentioned some are off put by this ai talk and might reconsider a career as a 3d artist. That means that you are biased toward downplaying this ai thing to keep that revenue coming from selling courses. 
Having said that the reality of these ai tools is fluff, all talk and no show, sci-fi, etc. and im speaking from experience and from seeing what others do with it. At best it can do some half decent concept art after numerous requests. 
The reality of it is that they dont even enhance or enrich the life of an artist because we dont have tools tailored for the artist, most of them try to circumvent the artist from the process. No ai UV mapping, no ai material generation, like why is it so hard to train ai to extract roughness map or normalmap from a photo!?
The reality of it is in the other comments saying that the clients started using ai at least partially instead of hiring artists.
I am a spare time solo game dev that uses photoshops ai to remove defects from photos (because thats all its good for). i will never pay for something like custom game music because i have no budget for that but if i can get a tool that can generate something half decent for almost nothing...

Even if I wasn't an educator, my opinion would still be the same.  AI does bring up some interesting thoughts on how the CGI business works in general.  As an example, ""Why do people hire CGI artists?""  I think the answer to that question is misunderstood by many people.  In the next video, I plan on taking a deeper dive into it.  Similarly to photographers, I don't think AI is going to replace them.  Why?  Because, just like photographers, CGI artists are in the business of customization.  It can't just be a ""wedding ceremony.""  It needs to be that person's wedding ceremony for photographers.  Similarly, it can't just be any ol' racoon in Guardians of the Galaxy, it needs to be ""Rocket Racoon.""  And he can't look different from one shot to the next.  AI is good at generalizing ideas, but it's not good at providing specific ideas on a continual basis due to how the technology works.  So, in that way, I don't think VFX artists need to be freaking out.",2024-03-10T23:53:30Z
2024-03-08T13:04:19Z,@DarkoMitev,NwEFBidvLBY,"I half agree on your points Tyler. The things that you are correct in my opinion are that yes as a tool ai can and will speed up workflows, enable smaller  companies to work faster and be more efficient. But... The point that most people are bitter about is how AI is trained and we get to the results we do. There is no way to prevent ai to train on your artwork, no way to protect a unique style that you are known for.  And protect is probably the wrong word for it but what i mean is people some times go to specific artist because they want their unique style of doing things and if an AI can generate this with a prompt, without the original artist to be compensated at all then in my opinion that is just theft. Because like you said, AI does not invent new things its a very good kit bash machine. By that definition it uses your work directly into making other things without consent. I recently found out that my 3D renders have been used in training  AI model and I am not happy about it because no one aske for permission, no one offered any sort of compensation etc.  The biggest grudge people have with AI is the generative part of it. If you can come up with a tool that can speed up GI calculations, remove the need for UV work, or any of these thigns then no one would be mad about it , in fact everyone will praise it! But the current implementation is not very ethical and this is the biggest problem people have with AI in my opinion.

2024-03-03T12:28:06Z,@stinosan,NwEFBidvLBY,"I remember conversations about digital photography in the late 90's. The argument was that it could never replace analog photography because it was incapable of achieving rich black and white values. I remember conversations about multi-touch interfaces when Apple released the first iPhone. The argument was that people would never be comfortable typing on a screen without tactile feedback. I remember conversations about Bitcoin back in 2014. People were comparing it to the Dutch tulip mania, ridiculing anyone who was willing to pay 150$ for a single Bitcoin...

Getting upset or angry at a technological revolution has never worked, you either adapt with it or you perish. The hard fact is that, the use of computer graphics, in non-interactive entertainment is coming to an end. Instead of fighting this, 3D artists should welcome the advent of emerging technologies like spatial computing. The transition to a more immersive, 3D based interaction with digital information will bring with it a plethora of new opportunities for skilled 3D artists.",2024-03-03T12:28:06Z
2024-03-03T15:37:41Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts @stinosan.  For 2D artists, I think the analogy of digital vs analogue photography is a good one.  The digital camera took on the same exact product and role as what the analogue camera did.  Looking back into the past, every highly successful technology always has a group of nay-sayers that were proven wrong.  However, there are also many technologies that we forget about because the nay-sayers were right.  3D printing has, no doubt, seen some success, however, it hasn't overtaken construction.  It hasn't overtaken the home goods market.  Or perhaps another one would be VR.  VR still hasn't dominated the video games industry.  People still buy consoles and PC games.  None of us are living in the metaverse either.  

So, in that way, I think AI will have a big impact on 2D / concept roles, but not as much for the 3D artist.  I gave an example in another comment that I'll paste here to give a specific scenario of what I'm talking about:

""Let me provide a practical example:  Company XYZ wants to showcase their new product at a trade show.  Everything has already been designed.  Prototypes have been made, and the concept portion of the pipeline has been long established.  Now, it's the job of the 3D artist to make Company XYZ's dream come true by making a cool reveal animation as the CEO is talking on stage.  We have a product that nobody has ever seen before.  It needs to look EXACTLY as it is in real life.  And, Company XYZ wants to get realllly picky about everything because the CEO has been dreaming of this moment for the past 5 years.  

How is AI going to do that?  How is the 3D artist's job similar to the 2D artists job?  How are you going to train it to create something that's never existed before?  What happens when AI gets the dimensions of the product off jusssst a little bit?  What tools does the 3D artist have to fix these issues and made sure that each shot has perfect consistency?  Again, customization and fine-tuned control is the name of the game for 3D artists, and their work is incomparable to 2D artists.

Even if AI continues to make incredible leaps in progress, it's not going to impact 3D artists in the same way as 2D artists because it's a whole different world of considerations.""",2024-03-03T15:37:41Z

Biggest issue right now for any artist is that “ what is the purpose of learning so called traditional way of learning “ because some machine can do within a second the image which the artist actually thought in mind and  was prepared to go the journey of achieving the result by manually creating it

Art work / musical /writing or any creative technical work is a journey and that is consistent for any human 

A human should have some purpose to live and go beyond ..It’s not just job satisfaction..  it’s a journey that is what is important.

We human can not compete with machine power .. never going to outperform them in terms of speed and calculation. But this is where the big question as this is reality and artwork , creative works takes time to
prepare . 

Also  the profit making industry will always come pounding on you take the last freedom you have .. 

In reality many people are learning AI skills just to save job without having any interest in it . For some it is just another avenue of making money 

It’s another rat race for very vast section of people on earth . 

In My opinion AI should only be used where it is really needed like .Robotics , medical , life threatening job etc

AI should be nonprofit entity ..but in reality it is going exactly opposite and big corporations are racing for that too

As VFX  is concern where many tools from AI will be surely great to use and that’s completely ok

And sorry, no those aren't ""strong"" counter-arguments. We already know that ""scarcity increases value"" but that's not true when demand has dropped, and that is what is happening. 2D & stop motion animators are not paid better, just b/c there's so few of them now.",2024-03-02T01:51:43Z
2024-03-02T21:43:21Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"I think the main area where we disagree here is on how similar 2D artwork is to 3D.  In my opinion, it's not even an ""apples to oranges"" comparison... it's more of an ""apples to tricycles"" comparison.  The two mediums are much more different than people think they are.  A client is going to hire 3D artists for completely different reasons than for hiring a 2D artist.  Generating ideas is typically the goal for 2D artists whereas customization and fine-tuned control is the goal for 3D artists. 

Let me provide a practical example:  Company XYZ wants to showcase their new product at a trade show.  Everything has already been designed.  Prototypes have been made, and the concept portion of the pipeline has been long established.  Now, it's the job of the 3D artist to make Company XYZ's dream come true by making a cool reveal animation as the CEO is talking on stage.  We have a product that nobody has ever seen before.  It needs to look EXACTLY as it is in real life.  And, Company XYZ wants to get realllly picky about everything because the CEO has been dreaming of this moment for the past 5 years.  

You really think AI is going to be way to go here?  How is the 3D artist's job similar to the 2D artists job?  How are you going to train it to create something that's never existed before?  What happens when AI gets the dimensions of the product off jusssst a little bit?  What tools does the 3D artist have to fix these issues and made sure that each shot has perfect consistency?  Again, customization and fine-tuned control is the name of the game for 3D artists, and their work is incomparable to 2D artists.

Even if AI continues to make incredible leaps in progress, it's not going to impact 3D artists in the same way as 2D artists because it's a whole different world of considerations.",2024-03-02T21:43:21Z

AI doesn't need to do 3D. 🤷‍♂ 

Have you not seen the woman walking down the street at night in Tokyo. No Modeler, no Rigger, no Animator no Texture artist no Cloth FX artist no Lookdev artist no Lighter no Compositor. That's 8 artists out of work right there. Just a VFX supe and director typing prompts.

Just how you're seeing 'more' work - or even just no loss in amount of work - in all that, baffles me. 

""made sure that each shot has perfect consistency""

AI is already doing better medical diagnosis than human doctors are. Computers have always been more consistent than humans. 

"" product at a trade show""? 
3D graphics have been notoriously off the actual product, by at least as much as AI would be. That even happens with photographing the actual product. And that would probably be far easier to re-do using AI.

For example- SORA does not 'do' vfx- it simply obviates the need for them by implementing an understanding of things like fluid dynamics and soft body interactions at 'render' time- in SORA we see the potential that the whole production pipeline is compressed into a seamless  process in which design, animation and rendering are simulataneously realized- in the same way that a Midjourney image comes into existence not  as a linear sequence of sketch, final drawing, coloring ect but as a single emergent process where intial 'noise' is refined into a coherent and detailed result.

Your position here may be a bit like the blacksmith whose certainty that no machine could shod a horse the way he can blinds him to the oncoming future where horses are replaced by the automobile. AI will not 'take our jobs', it will simply obviate the need for those jobs to exist in the first place.

As an Artist I was certain that no machine could ever do what I do when I create an image- and that is still true- but Midjourney does not do what I do, it does something totally different- yet in the end the images it creates can in some senses compete with my own creations. The point is that 3D art is not normally an end in itself- it is usually a means to an end. If a cheaper, faster and thus more efficiant means to that end becomes available then it will be that technique that will prevail.",2024-03-01T18:00:10Z
2024-03-02T00:53:33Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"On a surface level, that all sounds correct, but it doesn't hold up in my mind once you get into the details.  Clients want customized results.  If they didn't, then they'd just go with stock footage / images.  3D artists are in the business of customization.  I spoke a bit about an example in another comment that provides a specific scenario.  I'll paste it here...

""...However, there will reach a point where some clients start getting picky, (most of them do), and that's where things can fall apart with the AI scenario.  If, lets say, Geico wants their lizard dude to do burst through an exploding wall while he's dancing in mid-air and the fire is a little bit off, how is AI going to be able to go in there and help with those granular edits?  If you re-prompt it, then perhaps the dance will be off or the lighting on the lizard doesn't match properly with the timing of the explosion, or there's a weird little bug that happened for a split second where the AI got confused and now it's affecting how it interacts with the next few frames, and for some reason the lizard dude's face changed in the next sequence and etc etc etc....  There's a million little deal-breaker details without a solution.""

By comparison, just about everything has a solution when customization is the goal with CGI.  So, if you're in the business of selling customization to clients, wouldn't you want to use the methodologies that provide you the most control? -  Of course you would.  You never want to be in a scenario of telling a client that it's not possible.  It's not comparable to what's happening to 2D artists because the medium is completely different.  It works differently, it has different goals, different reasons for people engaging with it...  It's like comparing apples to tricycles.

2024-03-02T14:28:20Z,@paulhiggins5165,NwEFBidvLBY,"@@cgforge What you say is true- I would go further and make the point that using text to define images is inherently  flawed because if words could really define images in a precise way we would not need the images, the words alone would be enough. So the whole idea of 'Text to Image' or 'Text to video' is a bit ridiculous.

But in the real world where time is money and AI can do the job far cheaper than a human there will be a real temptation  to go with what the AI spits out, even if this is not exactly the result you were looking for.

There are two possible scenarios- one is that the outputs of AI are so superficially pleasing and easy to create that the market will simply adapt to the limits of the technology and accept those limits as a commercial inevitability. In this sceanrio human artists will be seen in most cases as an unaffordable luxury.

The second scenario is the one you suggest, which is that over time the limits of the technology will become less acceptable as the novelty wears off and human artists remain relevant. It's not clear to me which of these will turn out to be correct.

There is a tendancy I notice among Midjourney users to 'retrofit' their expectations to the outputs their prompts deliver, insisting that what the machine made was precisely what they intended it to make all along, despite the fact that these systems have randomness built in to their algorithms by design. This kind of self deception may also be a factor that plays into the acceptability of AI Generated content especially if clients take a more 'hands on' approach and start to use the AI's directly.",2024-04-18T02:41:38Z
2024-03-02T21:50:25Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"Well, ya know, when it comes to clients wanting to save money instead of customizing, that's where I go back to the stock footage argument.  If they wanted to save tons of money and that was their main priority, they'd just go spend 15 bucks at Envato and call it a day.  What's interesting is that both the vfx / animation business and stock media business have been steadily rising together for many years now.

And that's a great point when it comes to Midjourney users insisting that the machine made everything perfectly the way they wanted.  In the 3D biz, what the artist thinks is totally irrelevant though.  The trick is to make the client feel like it's everything they ever wanted, and that's a totally different challenge.

What's so unexpected about the whole generative AI thing is that it's not really replacing human skills with machine equivelent skills, it's eliminating the need for those skills entirely. Your arguements make the assumption that clients will continue to feel the need to interpose a 3D Artist between themselves and the final output, and as long as that remains true I think 3D artists are safe. But if the technology matures to the point where a client feels that they themselves can create exactly what they want ( or at least convince themselves that they have done so) then all bets are off. 

The real problem with AI in general is not that it is really as competant or capable as it's made out to be- but the results it can deliver create an illusion of competance that can be very compelling to people whose ability to discern good or bad aesthetics may not be that well developed. The result being that in place of genuinely skilled and talented creators we get dillettantes armed with AI who fondly imagine that the medicore derivative outputs they can create are in every way as good as those they once obtained from paid proffessionals.",2024-04-18T02:41:38Z

Yes, demand for digital visuals will keep increasing, and will accelerate, but let's be realistic. Look at some of those things sora is already putting out. If it can animatic a still image of a wave and within hours get to same level of quality that would take a couple of artists days or weeks... then nobody is going to hire those artists, they will hire the 1 artists to do the AI prompts and then comp out the mistakes of the AI generated video.
So yeah, there will be more demand for certain types of artists (prompters and compers) but less demand for things like FX in this case. This will also be industry specific, since i don't think that will impact film as much, but in advertising this is definitely going to require less FX. I recently worked on something where we literally had to recreate a print add they made, but make it move, look had to be 1-1, just with 3d sims and stuff. Sora would do that a LOT cheaper.
So while I agree it will create a lot of jobs overall, it will definitely also replace a lot of jobs.

2024-03-01T17:35:10Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"Hey Tim, thanks for sharing your thoughts.  You made a really good point about shifting demand towards prompter artists that's being taken away from 3D artists, and to a limited extent, I would agree in certain scenarios.  The main catch there, however, is that the client needs to be cool with having less control.  So, instead of a client having, lets say, 75% control over the specific end product via the normal 3D workflows, they need to be cool with, lets say, 50% control.

For some, that's no problem.  They're looking for a quick bit, and AI is a win for them in that scenario.  However, there will reach a point where some clients start getting picky, (most of them do), and that's where things can fall apart with the AI scenario.  If, lets say, Geico wants their lizard dude to do burst through an exploding wall while he's dancing in mid-air and the fire is a little bit off, how is AI going to be able to go in there and help with those granular edits?  If you re-prompt it, then perhaps the dance will be off or the lighting on the lizard doesn't match properly with the timing of the explosion.  There's a million little deal-breaker details without a solution.

If, in that scenario, production hits a wall with AI, then now they're going to be scrambling with how the heck they're going to fix up that fire which sends them running back to simming an explosion via Houdini and potentially starting from scratch again.  Over time, I think clients, too, will get stung by the lack of granular control, and that sting could lead them straight back to doing things the ""Ol' fashioned way"" and realizing that AI isn't designed to be used in that capacity.  Over time, studios and clients will discover those risks, and a lot of them will adjust back in the opposite direction.  Over time, AI will become more sophisticated, but even it can provide granular edits like that, it will be in an environment where many professionals have been burned to some degree by AI and probably skeptical to risk it again.

Things like control-net lets you control posing of a character. So you would input a animated character (yeah that would still need mo-cap or hand animation) and that would drive the AI model. You can make slight light tweaks the same way as well, this type of stuff already exists. You have plugins for various 3d software that lets you “render” with stable diffusion where it takes a basic input scene and lights and renders it with AI.

Of course there will be exceptions to where this stuff can be used, and there will still be 3d artists necessary, so your point in that the people that do stick around will be probably able to be paid reasonably well. But a lot of the traditional 3d jobs like fx artists, would disappear. Jobs where you control the creative direction do or help someone achieve the creative direction by knowing how to manipulate these AI models would have a lot of staying power though.

And yeah for the very specific clients that want to pixel fuck, traditional way of doing things would still need available, but given how it would be 10 times more expensive than the AI alternative, that would only be for the very big clients.",2024-03-02T08:34:11Z

I completely agree with CG Forge’s view because this is the truth, and there will also be another part of the truth. 3D does have more difficulties for AI to overcome than 2D, because 2D does not need to understand time logic, but all this is just a matter of the speed of technological progress. You should know that a year ago, AI videos were just of very laughable quality. Since 2D artists will be replaced by AI, there is no absolute safety for 3D artists. When AI can draw realistic 2D paintings, many 2D artists even looked at AI with a mocking attitude because AI couldn’t even draw fingers well, and this bug was fixed only within a few months. But having said that, strictly speaking, it cannot be said that AI has replaced these 2D artists. Perhaps these 2D artists are still engaged in 2D work, just using AI as a new tool, but inevitably their direct income may decrease because the disappearance of technical barriers makes the market more competitive. Some people say that the government will not allow AI to take away human jobs because they need job positions to create tax revenue. In fact, this statement is not valid. Just like after the industrial revolution, the government didn't care about workers who were laid off due to the popularization of machines, because the increased production capacity of factories created more profits and paid more taxes. Overall, I think AI will definitely have a big impact on the 3D job market, but AI will not make everyone unemployed, because there always needs to be someone doing debugging and bridging work, and there is still some distance from establishing a workflow centered on AI.

Same with some clients now, they start injecting AI goals and ideas , like is something you can just 'implement' out of the box in Pipeline, animate without constrains, or create this or that. Is either AI or Unreal, two things that people have mixing ideas . Many clients keep talking about Unreal as if it was some  magic tool, and think you can throw everything at it.  And Unreal is cool, but NO, is not like that, has limitations  specially when you start rising the bar.

Do you get the point now?,2024-03-01T14:47:43Z
2024-03-01T06:26:08Z,@Ryu_Hayabusa,NwEFBidvLBY,"Valid arguments. There’s obviously pluses with this tech. The thing is the ratio of those pluses vs minuses with AI. Generally AI is just another tool. How it’ll be mostly used is one of the questions. The rapid improvement of AI doesn’t seem to be slowing down. So, I think you’re right that it will be beneficial for midsize/small businesses. Although I do think AI will bring more problems, than solutions. I’ve seen a lot of people loosing their jobs in another industry as a “optimisation strategy”. It’s not just AI, but it’s the AI that made it possible for such large scale. Like in simple example, a company can have less people do more work.
Overall it’ll be interesting to see how it’ll go forward.",2024-03-01T06:26:08Z
2024-03-01T07:15:50Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"Yeah, most definitely - I agree that there'll be a lot of pros/cons that end up happening with it.  I didn't mention it as much in the video, but it would be interesting to know how many of the current layoffs are due to AI and how many layoffs are due to a combination of factors like outsourcing, tighter lending conditions, and an overall decline in viewership due to streaming wars + less movie ticket sales.  My guess is that many employers are saying that, ""AI is the reason you're getting fired,"" but in reality, there's probably a lot more to it than that.",2024-03-01T07:15:50Z

2024-03-01T06:20:43Z,@matthewalfonsodurante,NwEFBidvLBY,Like your positivity!  My main concern is proper compensation for all the artists whose work is used to train the models.  Hoping this will all get worked out to the artist's satisfaction ...,2024-03-01T06:20:43Z
2024-03-01T07:17:35Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,Indeed... artists have always been in a pinch when it comes to negotiating fair compensation.,2024-03-01T07:17:35Z
2024-03-01T06:11:14Z,@pramodnirwan,NwEFBidvLBY,"It seems the impact is becoming more apparent. Let me share an example: Earlier this year, we had a project where we initially planned to provide style frames and storyboarding for a client. We estimated the cost at around $12,000 for four senior artists to deliver high-quality concept art and storyboarding. However, the client opted out of this particular preproduction scope and instead utilized Midjourny to generate high-quality concept art and storyboarding at a fraction of the cost, without any negotiation. Consequently, we ended up handling only the production phase of the project, feeling somewhat disheartened as we saw preproduction tasks being automated. So what happened to those 4 Artist? 

This trend continued with another project involving 3D animation, where a reputable agency suggested using Wonder Dynamics AI as its reduce costs by up to 70%.  So no animators, no lighting and composting just some VFX prep. 

Now we receive from most of the clients storyboarding and concept art using AI, leading us to rethink our need for 2D concept artists.",2024-03-01T06:11:14Z
2024-03-01T07:32:44Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"Hey thanks for sharing, those are totally valid points.  I didn't mention it in the video, but my opinion for 2D artists like storyboard, concept, and matte painting is a bit different than my opinion with 3D artists.  I think AI is great at those specific tasks, but I disagree when that idea makes a big leap in overtaking an entire 3D pipeline soon.  Once you start getting into customized CGI territory, that's where it falls apart pretty quickly at replacing an entire pipeline.  I'm sure over time some tasks will become more efficient (like making secondary animation, improving compression techniques, helping texture artists select base images more quickly, and helping modelers with base models to refine), but those optimizations don't go the full mile like it does when compared to 2D artists and copywriters, and AI may never get to that point for certain tasks.  But yeah, it's interesting, and I suppose we'll see where it all goes.",2024-03-01T07:32:44Z
2024-03-01T14:31:59Z,@saedhmerakeb7089,NwEFBidvLBY,"@@cgforgeYou are right saying that less labor bumps the demand, but the curves (of offer and demand) don't necessarily overlap, I don't think the 4 artists mentioned in the comment would get jobs cause the demand have been multiplied by 4x, the same reasoning could apply in 3D, it's not necessary that the demand will follow the reduction in labor.",2024-03-01T14:31:59Z
2024-03-01T16:10:09Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"Yeah, @saedhmerakeb7089 I agree that the forces which move supply and move demand are not always the same.  I was talking about the dynamics of supply when people decide to leave the industry.  Less demand might exist for certain tasks (like concept art, story-boarding, etc). but if that causes productions to complete faster, then that may increase demand in general for productions, and that creates larger-than-usual demand for the less affected 3D artist jobs.",2024-03-01T16:10:09Z

I myself just had client who constantly kept coming back with some AI spit wanting me to make something similar. Finally I said politely that he probably should just use that AI spits he has and we parted ways. Not every client is worth keeping. People looking for quick and cheap anything will always be there. It took me long time to learn letting some clients go and say ""no"". For many reasons. Before it was ""look what my son did in photoshop"" or ""my wife wants it red"" and now its ""look what AI spit I got"". If somebody is stupid enough to trust AI to make storyboard that I can only pity the end result. But of course some will. People will always chase quick and easy money. Some will read a book, some will scroll tiktok videos. For those who choose tiktok you dont really need quality. AI spit will do. I prefer working for those book readers. Theres smaller number of them but also - number of people who can deliver what they are after isnt that big. More AI? Well, more mediocre jobs around.",2024-03-01T19:44:56Z

2024-03-01T02:02:21Z,@cgforge,NwEFBidvLBY,"That's a good point, but my counter-argument to that is why didn't texture artists go to the way-side when substance painter came onto the scene?  Substance was a HUGE time-saver over the previous workflows of UVing everything perfectly and relying on photoshop for everything.  And yet, demand didn't dry up for texture artists when that technology came around.  Faster iterations = more time for feedback / changes or a production getting completed more quickly.  That increases demand for movies / tv shows because either the quality goes up or the speed goes up.  That means more projects get on the docket for studios, and that means more demand for texture artist jobs.",2024-03-01T02:02:21Z

2024-03-01T01:17:52Z,@darinmurano,NwEFBidvLBY,"Well said sir. I believe the doom and gloom perspective is being fueled by two camps: artists that are relatively new to 3D/video/design (and haven’t had much experience in Production, or comprehend how important iterating is), and jaded artists who are scared for a variety of reasons. It’s cool what popular AI tools “can” do, but what they “can’t” do prevents them from ever being used in a Production pipeline…at least not as a final deliverable. What popular AI tools do well: story boards, parts of set extensions, brain storming, etc. They speed up the grunt work, and give you more time to spend on the thoughtful work. Professional machine learning has been used for decades. Ask anyone who has ever worked at ILM. Once a popular AI tool is able to preform a PERFECT Roto mask, junior artist won’t have to spend the first year of their career Roto-ing. It won’t be that a young artist can’t get into the industry, it means they won’t have to wait as long to start getting more fulfilling assignments. We still don’t know what the legal implications will be for training content. we say that the stock photo/video industry is dead. i predict some of these companies are going to start hiring creatives to build their own proprietary libraries of photos and videos to be used for training. did auto correct put copy editors out of a job?

We even got to mess around with adobes A.I tool for 4 of our projects for spruce ups on them which was fun to learn. She was all about stepping up in using the current tools in our disposal. Which made me feel better with my doubts. I've been using A.I like chat gpt and others on my phone ever since to help me get creative ideas for storytelling, painting ideas when I'm stuck in jams. ever since. i find it a godsend. when stuck in a jam to boost up ideas.

Right now, its focused on producing images, but eventually that will include creating 3D models, animations, code, and much more.  Then it will be replacing artists and then see if you feel the same then.
Your argument about flying cars vs what computers what will be capable of... well, not a very good comparison.  Flying cars have real energy problems, but computers have no such limitations on producing content.
And as far as the AI producing something new... we all know that Hollywood is just a recycling machine, studios are more than happy to regurgitate the same movies over and over, its rare when something original comes out.
AI is going to dissuade a lot of future artists from going to school or entering the field because a lot of it will be able to be done without them.",2024-03-01T01:16:18Z

It could be near it's max potential right now.  It could have a long way to go.
